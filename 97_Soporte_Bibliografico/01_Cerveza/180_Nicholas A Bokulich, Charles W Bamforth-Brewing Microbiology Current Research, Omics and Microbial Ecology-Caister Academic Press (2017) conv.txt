Research into brewing yeast and other organisms associated with beer and brewing has experienced many important advances in the past decade. These have been nudged in no small way by staggering technological advances in tools fundamental to the investigation of microbes and their metabolism. Cutting-edge approaches, such as highly parallel nucleotide sequencing, genetic modification and mass spectrometry, are leading to new discoveries across the field of brewing microbiology.
The goal of this volume is to survey the most recent discoveries in brewing microbiology, with an emphasis on omics techniques and other modern technologies. The chapters span an array of subjects, including yeast genomics and evolution; the physi-ology, handling, metabolism and genetic regulation of brewing yeasts; genetic modification; taxonomy of  both  Saccharomyces  and  non-Saccharomyces yeasts; the biology and management of spoilage organisms (both fungal and bacterial); microbial ecology of traditional and ‘wild’ fermentations; and fungal contamination of barley and malt.
Advances in each of these topics have not only furthered our knowledge of brewing processes, they have yielded applications that touch all aspects of brewing practice, from barley growth and malting to yeast management, strain selection, fermentation control, and quality assurance. Consumer interests and brewing technologies continue to shift, yield-ing  new  challenges  and  research  frontiers.  For example, trends towards lower-alcohol beers have

altered quality assurance demands, and a growing global interest in ‘wild’ and otherwise sour beers has spurred the need to better understand the ecol-ogy of traditional beer fermentations and biology of non-Saccharomyces yeasts. Other recent research has revealed that lager yeasts, which are responsible for fermentation of the majority of beers consumed globally, are actually the progeny of hybridization events that occurred only a few centuries ago (likely selected  by  contemporaneous  advances  in  cave brewing technology), and hence only a few dis-tinct lager strain lineages are available. Now, novel techniques for high-throughput hybridization have yielded dozens more, broadening the range and characteristics of strains available to brewers.
The chapters in this volume aim not only to illuminate recent progress, but also to discuss its impact on brewing practices. We also discuss future research directions, setting out a vision for the next decade of discovery. We are on the cusp of many great innovations, and have only begun to tap the potential of the new tools that pave the way.

Abstract
Characterization of the genomes of yeast belong-ing to the genus Saccharomyces, including those used in brewing, has been the subject of intense investigation.  Fundamental  differences  between ale and lager strains have been demonstrated. The linkage of many genes with cellular function has been made. Although essential, this has also high-lighted a fundamental lack of knowledge as to how expression of the genome is made manifest in terms of phenotype, in particular how the phenotype is regulated at the level of the metabolome. The inten-tion of this chapter is to review current research that has been directed towards these ends. The chapter addresses how yeast physiology is influenced by the conditions it is exposed to in current modern brewing practice, what are the potential pitfalls, and how can processes be managed to increase the like-lihood of a controlled and consistent outcome. Of particular note are the factors that influence passage of cells into and out of quiescence, coincident with fermentation initiation and eventual removal of cropped yeast to storage. Since the majority of pub-lished studies have used haploid laboratory strains grown aerobically on semi-defined media, attempts have been made to extrapolate results to encompass brewing strains serially re-pitched in semi-aerobic fermentations using wort as the feedstock.


Introduction
Yeast of the genus Saccharomyces is one of the most intensively studied of all eukaryotic organ-isms and, in consequence, a huge and somewhat daunting body of literature exists that is devoted

to the science underlying its activities. It is neither possible nor desirable to attempt to provide an overview of this in its entirety; instead, the object of this chapter is to describe some recent literature that describes the elucidation of the physiological response of brewing yeast to the conditions experi-enced in modern commercial brewing practice. For a general overview of brewing yeast and fermenta-tion, the reader is referred to Boulton and Quain (2001). Most of the yeast literature describes work that employed haploid laboratory strains of Sac-charomyces cerevisiae. A much smaller proportion of the literature embraces brewing yeast strains. This presents some dificulties in that lager brewing strains are very different, being hybrid in nature and possessing a polyploid/aneuploid genome (see Chapter 4). It follows that in the case of some of the work described here there is an assumption that it will apply to brewing strains, although, of course, this may not be entirely true.
At the highest level, cells respond to environ-mental changes by modifications to expression of the genome. Much published work has described how this is accomplished and knowledge of the genome  of  brewing  yeast  strains  continues  to expand and fewer orphan genes remain; however, the hybrid nature of lager strains introduces added complication in that the mosaic of duplicated genes allows  for  much  variation  between  individual strains  (Wendland,  2014).  The  ways  in  which genotypic  changes  are  made  manifest  in  terms of the physiological response are not extensively reported and yet it is these responses that underpin much that is of importance in terms of the ability of yeast to transform wort into beer in a manner that is
2 |  Boulton


eficient and predictable. Thus, changes in external conditions can prompt large changes in genome expression but of themselves these are insuficient to account for the fine tuning of cellular metabolism required to underpin translational responses. This is accomplished by another hierarchy of responses which  include  regulation  of  mRNA  stability, allosteric control of enzyme activity and a set of post-translational controls in which the activities of individual enzymes are modified by reactions such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination. Predictably, major carbon-metabolizing pathways such  as  glycolysis,  those  involved  in  fermenta-tion and the control of reserve carbohydrates are subject to close regulation via post-translational mechanisms  (Tripodi  et  al.,  2014).  A  measure of the potential importance of these methods of control may be inferred from the finding of Olivera and Sauer (2014) that around half of the enzymes of S. cerevisiae involved in metabolic networks are phosphoproteins.  Undoubtedly,  elucidating  the fine details of these cellular regulation methods will pay rich dividends in terms of gaining a better understanding of the behaviour of yeast throughout the brewing process.


The brewing yeast cycle
An obvious characteristic of yeast belonging to the genusSaccharomyces is an ability to survive in a wide variety of conditions; perhaps more specifically, an ability to adapt its phenotype rapidly in response

to changes in the environment in order that it may grow and proliferate where conditions permit this or simply survive where they do not. Modern brew-ing practices test these abilities to the full as will be described.
The majority of modern commercial brewers practise  a  semi-conservative  process  in  which yeast derived from fermentation is recovered from the immature beer, retained in a storage vessel and a proportion used to inoculate a subsequent fermentation. This process of serial fermentation is continued typically for 5–15 successive fermenta-tions (referred to by brewers as ‘generations’), after which the yeast is disposed of and replaced by a new culture derived from laboratory stocks and intro-duced into the brewery via a process of propagation (Fig. 1.1).
The  brewing  yeast  cycle  has  several  conse-quences. The sequence of events represented by inoculation  (pitching),  growth,  cropping,  and storage requires cells to undergo a series of tran-sitions in which they are exposed to rapid and dramatic  changes  in  environmental  conditions. In the storage phase, cells are starved of nutrients but usually exposed to low temperature (2–4°C), anaerobic conditions, and relatively high ethanol conditions. In many breweries, before pitching, yeast cells are treated with an acidulant such as phosphoric acid with the aim of killing less acid-tolerant bacteria. In this ‘acid washing’ step, the pH is reduced from around pH 4.0 to pH 2.1–2.3 and, at least in a properly controlled process, the

cells are held at a temperature of around 3°C for a period of 1–2 hours (Simpson and Hammond, 1989). During pitching, the cells undergo a shift to higher temperature (although one much lower than that optimal for growth) and exposure to oxygenated wort. Thus, cells undergo a transition to aerobic conditions in a complete growth medium, albeit one that is relatively unbalanced, having a very high sugar concentration and comparatively smaller concentrations of other essential nutrients. Transfer to wort is accompanied by a concomitant osmotic shock and in the large capacity and tall ves-sels most commonly used in modern brewing the cells have considerable hydrostatic pressure exerted on them. As growth proceeds, the yeast exhausts the available oxygen and conditions revert to anaer-obic; nutrients are assimilated; and the principal
products, ethanol and CO2, accumulate together
with a multitude of other metabolic products, some
of which influence beer flavour. Ethanol and CO2
both exert toxic effects on yeast cells. In modern high-gravity brewing practice, it is common to use highly concentrated worts as a means of increas-ing fermentation productivity. The concentrated beers produced in this process are then diluted to ‘sales gravity’ prior to packaging. The osmotic pressures generated as a consequence of high-sugar concentrations in these worts and the consequent high yields of ethanol increase the stress levels experienced by yeast (Udeh and Kgatia, 2013). Commonly, wort strength is increased by the addi-tion of relatively pure sugar syrups since these are usually less expensive compared to malted barley. The effect of this is to dilute the non-sugar compo-nents and thereby render the wort an even more unbalanced growth medium.
As fermentation proceeds, the majority of brew-ing strains settle to the bottom of the vessel to form a sediment in which the cells are subject to the poten-tially damaging combination of high hydrostatic pressure and high levels of carbonation and ethanol. In those strains capable of doing so, sedimentation is aided by the process of flocculation (Vidgren and Londesborough, 2011). At some stage in the fermentation, yeast, with some entrained beer, is cropped from fermenter, chilled and transferred back into a storage vessel where it may be held for up to 7 days (typically 2 – 5 days). After this time, another cycle of growth is initiated by pitch-ing stored yeast into fresh wort. Cylindroconical

fermenters  (the  type  most  commonly  used  in modern brewing practice) are designed to allow removal of yeast crops with a minimum of back-mixing. Thus, there is a spatial relationship between the location of yeast in the crop in the cone of the vessel and the timing of its removal. By inference, the brewer has the opportunity to make a choice over which fraction to retain for re-pitching. This is significant in that Powell et al. (2002) noted that there was considerable heterogeneity in terms of location of cells in the cone crop and factors such as cell size, replicative age, flocculation characteristics and levels of storage carbohydrates. Predictably, there was concomitant variability in subsequent fermentation  performance  depending  on  which cells were re-pitched.
The  modern  brewing  process  is  potentially harmful to yeast and prolonged serial fermentation increases the likelihood of contamination and the potential for the emergence of genetic variants. It is for this reason that after a given number of serial fermentations, the precise number chosen by individual brewers on a more or less empirical basis, the yeast culture is disposed of and replaced with a new one of guaranteed identity and purity. The propagation process used by the majority of large- scale commercial brewers involves carrying out a series of batch cultures of ever-increasing size until suficient biomass is generated to pitch a full-scale production fermentation. In the propagation phase, wort is used as the growth medium and yeast growth, in excess of that observed in fermentation, is encouraged by the provision of continuous oxy-genation. Fed-batch approaches, in which biomass yields far in excess of those achievable by conven-tional brewery propagations on wort are used for the production of active dried yeast, a product used by many of the new generation of craft brewers (Jenkins et al., 2011).
Compared with many other industrial processes and certainly the majority of laboratory studies, brewing fermentation pitching rates are relatively high, typically 15–20 million cells per ml (ca 0.8– 1.2g/l dry weight) in a high-gravity wort of 15–20° Plato. During fermentation, growth is modest, usu-ally a 3- to 4-fold increase in cell biomass. A result of this is that the pitched cells not only play an active part in fermentation but may also survive through to cropping and re-pitching. Yeast cells undergo an ageing process that, unless cut short by other
4 |  Boulton


causes, culminates in senescence and death (Steink-raus et al., 2008). Depending on the fraction of crop retained for re-pitching, there is the possibility of a gradual increase in the average cell replicative age with each generation.


Yeast physiological response to the brewing process, transitions between growth and non-growth
Most cell types spend the majority of their lifes-pans in a quiescent state where proliferation is not occurring and metabolism may be in a resting state (Hartwell et al., 1974; Werner-Washburne, 1993). When conditions are suitable, cells may leave this quiescent stage and initiate a new cell cycle. The ability to enter the quiescent phase in a controlled manner, such that metabolism is manipulated in a way that favours survival, is clearly essential as is the requirement for timely re-entry into active growth when conditions allow. In both cases there is a need, as early as possible, to be able to detect changes in external conditions so that the process of pheno-typic re-ordering can commence. In the case of an assembly of individual cells, such as is represented by yeast participating in the brewing process, an element of cooperation is also desirable in order to select the fraction of the population deemed most suitable for survival and proliferation.
In the case of yeast participating in the brew-ing process, passage into and out of quiescence coincides with the ending of one fermentation, the period of intermediate storage, and initiation of the next. Typically, the storage period lasts for 1–5 days and fermentation for 1–2 weeks, and thus brewing yeast cells perhaps spend less time in the quies-cent phase and commensurately longer in growth compared with other cell types. The term ‘end of fermentation’ requires some clarification. For many modern lager fermentations, which encompasses the majority of beer currently produced globally, yeast may be held for a period of days in vessel at a comparatively warm temperature, prior to cropping. In this phase, growth in terms of cell proliferation has ceased; however, outward signs of metabolic activity remain manifest. These include changes that have importance to beer flavour, most notably the assimilation and reduction of vicinal diketones,

namely diacetyl and pentanedione (Krogerus and Gibson, 2013).
In terms of the cell cycle, the quiescent state
is referred to as G0  and is characterized as cells
that are neither budding nor preparing to bud. Although numerous studies have been published describing  the  response  of  the  genome  to  the transitions from growth to quiescence (Wu et al., 2004; Coller et al., 2006; Shimanuki et al., 2007), comparatively few reports discuss this subject at the level of cellular physiology. Clearly the ability of yeast cells to undergo the reversible shifts from quiescence to growth is of critical importance in brewing fermentations. Surprisingly, this subject remains poorly understood for all cell types. Pre-dictably, the majority of studies devoted to yeast have used aerobically grown haploid laboratory strains undergoing diauxic shift where cells arrest after exhausting glucose from the medium and in a second lag phase adjust their metabolism to undergo a second growth phase on ethanol pro-duced in the first. In the absence of studies devoted to brewing fermentation, it is to these investigations that reference must be made. How well they relate to the peculiar conditions of brewing fermenta-tions is a moot point. In particular, the fact that the majority of these laboratory studies have used a carbon-limiting medium, obviously the opposite situation to brewing wort where the ratio of carbon to other nutrients is very high.

Quiescent yeast cells
Compared with actively growing cells, those in the
G0 phase have enhanced thermotolerance, partly a
result of a thickened cell envelope and elevated levels of  carbohydrate  reserves,  notably  glycogen  and trehalose (Gray et al., 2004), as might be expected for cells adopting a strategy for survival. The shift into  quiescence  occurs  in  response  to  nutrient limitation via the concerted action of, amongst other factors, the activities of a number of protein kinases that participate in cellular cascade control pathways (Smets et al., 2010). It has been assumed
that the shift to quiescence only takes place in G1
phase cells (Pardee, 1974); however, other work has shown that cells may enter this phase from any point in the cell cycle (Wei et al., 1993; Laporte et al., 2011). In the latter paper, the authors grew yeast on a carbon-limited medium and noted that within the stationary phase population approximately 90%

of the cells were unbudded and the remaining 10% budded. Examination of the two subpopulations revealed that both groups had the same charac-teristics in terms of markers of quiescent cells and both sets were capable of resuming proliferation when suitable nutrients were supplied. The authors went on to separate budded and unbudded quies-cent cells by micromanipulation and tested their relative abilities to form colonies on solid nutrient medium. Both types were capable of this; however, the budded fraction were much less able (65% of budded cells compared with 95% unbudded). This mirrors observations made in relation to brew-ing propagation, where it has also been seen that cells in the stationary phase culture after aerobic growth on malt wort had a much higher budding index compared with the same yeast cropped from fermentation (Miller et al., 2012). These authors noted that when the new culture was pitched into the first generation fermentation, there was a lack of synchrony in terms of the move into growth between the budded and unbudded fraction, and it was suggested that this was the basis of the fre-quent observation that these first fermentations give slower cycle times compared with yeast of an older  generation.  Conversely,  cropped  pitching yeast has a much lower budding index, suggesting that in this case the transition to quiescence leads to a more homogeneous population (Miller et al., 2012). Perhaps this is linked to the fact that in a brewery fermentation growth extent may be limited by the quantity of oxygen supplied initially, whereas in propagation it is likely to be another nutrient, in most cases probably amino nitrogen or possibly zinc.
The question has been posed whether the pas-sage into quiescence is the result of following a genetically based programme that, once committed to, must progress to completion, rather like START in the cell cycle; or whether it is simply a number of passive adaptations that occur in response to adverse conditions (Daignan-Fornier and Sagot, 2011). These authors, in reviewing their own work and that of others, make several pertinent points. In yeast, the quiescent stage is entered in response to nutrient limitation; however, profiles of mRNA in quiescent cells are different depending on the limiting nutrient and the transcription of only a few genes are common to different nutrient limitations. This suggests that there is not a signature quiescent

gene profile. At the metabolomics level there is little commonality between cells starved for differ-ent nutrients, supporting the view that quiescence is an adaptive response to growth at a very low rate. However, it can also be demonstrated that, independent of the nature of the limiting nutrient, cells undergo a common series of cellular adap-tions associated with quiescence and these occur in response to sensing systems that are able to detect declining levels of nutrients and predict the onset of starvation. In this sense, there may be a number of different quiescent states depending on the prior history of the cell.
Quiescent yeast cells undergo structural reor-ganization during the transition to non-growth. The actin cytoskeleton is reorganized to give so-called ‘actin bodies’, which may act as actin reserves that can be rapidly changed back into a functional form when nutrients become available (Sagot et al.,  2006).  In  addition,  the  proteasome  moves from the nucleus to form a cytoplasmic structure termed the proteasome storage granule (Laporte et al., 2008). This is accompanied by the concen-tration of many cytosolic metabolic enzymes into discrete structures (Narayanaswamy et al., 2009). Other cellular components are also organized into pools from where they may be rapidly mobilized to facilitate re-entry into proliferation. For example, quiescent cells contain large cytosolic processing bodies where mRNA molecules are held ready to participate in translation when growth-permitting conditions  arise.  Similarly,  it  has  been  demon-strated that, although many genes are repressed in the transition to stationary phase, transcription is held in a state in which it can be rapidly reactivated when the need arises (Radonjic et al., 2006).
Population heterogeneities in stationary phase cells have been reported (Allen et al., 2006). These authors studied differences in cells in the stationary phase as they underwent the diauxic shift. They were able to separate quiescent and non-quiescent yeast cells based on differences in density. A fraction of the population recovered from a glucose-exhausted medium   comprised   small,   dense,   unbudded daughter cells. On completion of diauxy, these were able synchronously to re-enter mitotic divi-sion. The suggestion was that these daughter cells derived from cell division in the diauxic phase, after which they underwent changes leading to density increase, partly attributable to enhanced trehalose
6 |  Boulton


accumulation and a thickened cell wall. A smaller subpopulation of cells apparently did not enter the quiescent phase and these, although viable, rapidly lost the ability to undergo mitosis and became necrotic. A smaller group of cells within this subset exhibited properties of quiescent cells.
Li et al. (2013), again working with glucose-grown cells undergoing diauxic shift, used flow cytometry to separate the three distinct cell types described by Allen et al. (2006). They confirmed that within these groups was a subpopulation of quiescent cells that were small, had thickened cell walls, and were extremely heat-tolerant. These cells comprised a population of daughter cells formed as a consequence of an asymmetric budding event triggered by the diminishing glucose concentration. Time was required for cells to respond to changes in glucose concentration. Indeed, if the supply was abruptly removed the budding event resulting in the generation of resistant daughter cells was disrupted (Li et al., 2013). The quiescent daughter
cells were homogeneous and arrested in the G1
phase and highly resistant to applied stresses. In the quiescent state they have very long lifespans and are able to begin synchronous proliferation, should conditions change to growth-permitting (Li et al., 2009). The falling glucose concentration triggers a survival response in which there is a lengthening
of the G1 phase, and the quiescent daughter cells
have an altered metabolism in which accumulation of both glycogen and trehalose are favoured (Miles et al., 2013). These storage carbohydrates provide a source of carbon and energy to allow survival in the starvation phase and during the subsequent transition from quiescence to growth. In addition, trehalose has a protective role as a stabilizer of membranes and proteins against stresses such as heat and desiccation (Silljé et al., 1999; Elbein et al., 2003). Although these carbohydrates clearly have important roles in survival of potential starva-tion conditions, they are not determinative of the quiescent state since not all cells with elevated intra-cellular levels can give rise to quiescent daughters (Li et al., 2013). The second and third subpopula-tions comprised a much smaller fraction of mother cells that had undergone the shift to quiescence and non-quiescent mother cells.
The transition to quiescence has been shown in the work described above to be related to the abil-ity of cells to sense impending glucose exhaustion

(Ozcan et al., 1996; Grose et al., 2007; Conrad et al., 2014). In the case of brewery fermentations, the growth-determining nutrient is usually unknown and probably varies with different types of wort; however, it is never sugar. Where high levels of sugar   adjuncts   are   used,   nitrogen-containing nutrients, notably free amino nitrogen, can be low and may be limiting, although this has rarely been subject to proper investigation. In many brewery fermentations, it is often assumed that oxygen is the limiting substrate via its role in anaerobic pitch-ing yeast as substrate for synthesis of sterols and unsaturated fatty acids (see ‘Response of yeast to oxygen’, below). How does this relate to the tran-sition to quiescence? Using chemostat cultures, Hazelwood et al. (2009) investigated the effects of growth under different nutrient limitations on accu-mulation of trehalose and glycogen. They observed that, in addition to glucose, limitation of ammonia, phosphate, sulfur, and zinc were all influential and by inference storage carbohydrate accumulation was not simply a result of glucose excess. Glucose and ammonia limitation gave 10- to 14-fold more glycogen than growth under conditions of glucose excess. In addition to glycogen, trehalose accumu-lation was favoured by ammonia limitation. The responses were attributed to post-transcriptional regulation rather than transcriptional regulation alone. Li et al. (2013) studied the events occurring in diauxy and concluded that glucose limitation resulted in differentiation into three cell types. One fraction comprised very small quiescent daughter cells that arose from highly asymmetric budding. These  cells  acquired  enhanced  thermotolerance and accumulated high levels of reserve carbohy-drates.  Differentiation  between  quiescent  and non-quiescent cells occurred shortly after diauxy and it was concluded that post-transcriptional regu-lation of mRNA played a crucial role.
The  passage  into  quiescence,  as  judged  by formation of proteasome storage bodies and actin re-ordering, is seemingly dependent on lack of carbon. Laporte et al. (2011) reported that nitro-gen-starved yeast cells acquired thermotolerance but did not exhibit the actin skeleton and protea-some modifications. Both starvation of carbon and transfer to distilled water did, presumably indicat-ing the primacy of the glucose signal.
The yeast cell wall is highly plastic in nature and changes in its structure occur in response to

environmental changes (Klis et al., 2002, 2006). Remodelling  of  cell  wall  structure  is  regulated by the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway (Levin, 2011). This system responds to signals received at the cell surface, either as a consequence of normal growth or as environmental challenges, via the appropriate  sensors  and  transmits  these  to  the intracellular targets that mediate the appropriate response. The key element is a G protein, termed Rho1.  This  switching  protein  integrates  signals from the cell surface and the cell budding cycle, and controls cell wall biogenesis and actin organization. With  regard  to  entry  into  quiescence,  the increased density of small quiescent daughter cells is in part due to thickening of the cell wall and this change is related to enhanced longevity (Li et al., 2009). Cells become stronger mechanically and less porous. These changes are in part a conse-quence of the presence of proteins that, based on the observation that they can be removed by treat-ment with dithiothreitol, are anchored by disulfide bonds (Shimoi et al., 1998; Jansen, 2009). There is a 6- to 7-fold increase in the level of disulfide link-ages in stationary phase cells compared with those growing exponentially (de Nobel et al., 1990). The most abundant cell wall protein in quiescent cells is a GPI cell wall protein termed Sed1 (Shimoi et al., 1998). GPI (glycophosphate phosphatidylino-sitol) cell wall proteins are those in which the lipid moiety is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and from there used to transport proteins to the cell membrane where they may then be further modi-fied and inserted into the cell wall. Here they are covalently bonded to cell wall glucans (Pittet and Conzelmann, 2007). The function of some of these appears to be to deliver mRNA to P bodies, where they are stored and therefore help maintain the qui-escent cell wall phenotype. Release of these at the
appropriate time facilitates re-entry into growth.

Transition from quiescence to growth
The passage from quiescence to growth occurs in the lag phase of fermentation. It is in the interest of brewers to have as short a lag time as possible, and therefore identification of the factors that regu-late  its  duration  is  of  commercial  importance. Just as entry into quiescence is via a programmed sequence of cellular events, so is exit. The process is distinct from growth, as measured in terms of increase in cellular biomass, and proliferation, as

manifested by budding. Exit from quiescence must be as tightly regulated as entry and must only occur when conditions are favourable for growth to occur. By inference, premature exit will cause cells to lose their  resistant  phenotypes  and  almost  certainly result  in  cell  death.  Nevertheless,  as  described in  the  previous  section,  the  evidence  suggests that in the quiescent phase cells have adopted a phenotypic state in which they are poised to pass into the growth phase as soon as conditions allow. Daignan-Fornier and Sagot (2011) summarized the quiescent stage as a convergence between cellular adaption to cope with adversity and preparation for eficient resumption of proliferation.
Laporte et al. (2011) used re-ordering of the actin skeleton and disassembly of the proteasome storage granule as markers of passage into growth, and noted that addition of glucose alone was sufi-cient to trigger these changes. They concluded that the presence of the sugar was suficient to initiate the early steps of passage from quiescence, and this occurred even when de novo protein synthesis was inhibited, and thus independent of growth and proliferation. Activation by glucose required metabolism at least as far as pyruvate but did not require the formation of ATP. This adds weight to the suggestion that there is a two-way interplay between cellular signalling and regulatory systems and the intracellular concentrations of relatively small molecular weight metabolic intermediates. These metabolic activities are not simply required for energy generation (McKnight, 2010).


Cellular signalling systems
Proper regulation of the phenotype requires cells to possess a method of interrogating the external envi-ronment and responding in an appropriate manner. This is accomplished by the use of arrays of sensors capable of detecting the nutritional and stress status of the environment, coupled to pathways through which signals are transmitted to targets that adjust metabolism to elicit an appropriate response. The relative simplicity of using S. cerevisiae as a model cell has made it a favourite for studying this subject and a great deal is now known, albeit much less in the case of brewing strains. Conrad et al. (2014) have published an excellent review summarizing current knowledge.
Several signalling systems are recognized and

they share in common the ability of cells to sense the concentrations of relatively simple nutrients, and to generate multiple responses. The latter is obvious since, for example, starvation of an essential nutrient must not only switch off pathways neces-sary for growth and proliferation but must also re-engineer metabolism so that the cell acquires a resistant phenotype. Conversely, when conditions become growth-promoting these changes must be reversible. Responses to external cues must be suf-ficiently rapid to allow timely metabolic shifts and this suggests that many of the changes are likely to involve post-translational modifications. Different levels of control are exquisitely poised to elicit an appropriate response.
Signalling pathways identified in yeast include those  for  glucose  repression  and  concomitant fermentative   metabolism,   nitrogen   catabolite repression, general amino acid control, phosphate regulation, and regulatory responses triggered by sulfate, metal ions, and some vitamins. Signalling pathways may be implicated in the regulation of uptake of a single or small related class of nutrients; alternatively, general nutrient signalling systems are responsive to the concentrations of multiple classes of nutrients that elicit more global shifts, such as control of biomass formation, progression through the cell cycle, acquisition of stress tolerance, accu-mulation or mobilization of storage reserves, and apoptosis. Conrad et al. (2014) provide the illu-minating example that starvation of both zinc and iron will individually trigger the induction of their respective high-afinity uptake systems but with no cross-talk. However, starvation of both ions also elicits a common general response in which growth arrests and there is an increase in stress tolerance. Receptors that are specific to a single or small group of molecules and cause induction of separate specific uptake systems may have themselves, in an earlier evolutionary phase, functioned as trans-porters, although they have now lost this function (Ozcan et al., 1996).
In order to exert their effects, it is suggested that the triggering nutrients require some degree of metabolic processing. This is consistent with the observation that, for example, the ability of exog-enous glucose to cause transition from quiescence requires metabolism at least to pyruvate (McKnight, 2010). The general responses require a target capa-ble of responding to multiple nutrients. Responses

may be long or short term and involve different mechanisms. This would be expected to allow for both rapid adjustment of the carbon flux through specific pathways to allow cells to make selective advantage of sudden changes in the environment, and slower global changes such as passage into and out of quiescence. The longer-term responses appear to be via regulation of the genotype, notably by nutrients of ribosomal protein gene expression (Grifioen et al., 1996). The more rapid responses are  mediated  by  cascades  of  phosphorylation, involving reactions between target enzymes and kinases and phosphatases with regulatory func-tions. It has been reported that, of 204 enzymes involved in central carbon and amino-acid metabo-lism, some 35 were observed to change their degree of  phosphorylation  under  five  different  growth conditions  (Oliveira  et  al.,  2012;  Oliveira  and Sauer, 2012). Signals are transmitted in reactions in which, for example, starvation of several individual nutrients interact reversibly with a common target kinase, and in response the activities of multiple pathways are modulated by the targets of the kinase. In S. cerevisiae, some 120 kinases and 40 phos-phatases have been identified (Bodenmiller et al., 2010). The effect of phosphorylation on the target protein can result in inactivation or activation by conformational changes, access to the catalytic site, tagging for degradation, intra-organelle transloca-tion, and facilitating association or disassociation with multiprotein complexes (Oliveira et al., 2012).

Assimilation and metabolism of sugars
In order to regulate cell size, a system is required for coordinating growth in terms of biomass formation and the processes of cellular proliferation. Implicit in this is a need to be able to sense cell size and the availability of nutrients (Dungrawala et al., 2012). In yeast the critical point in the cell cycle is START, which once passed commits cells to progress irre-
versibly from G1  to S phase. Cells must achieve
a critical size before they pass through START; nevertheless, providing conditions are conducive, biomass formation is a continuous process since blocking  growth  before  START  restricts  prolif-eration, whereas disruption of CDC genes, which regulate cell division, leads to the formation of abnormally large cells (Johnston et al., 1977).
Saccharomyces spp. yeasts exhibit high rates of

glucose uptake and glycolysis coupled to fermenta-tive metabolism even under aerobic conditions, the so-called Crabtree effect (de Deken, 1966). A similar situation occurs in cancer cells although in this case it is termed the Warburg effect (Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011). These similarities, coupled with the amenability of yeast cells as a model system, have provided the impetus for a huge body of work to elucidate the genetic and biochemical bases of the observations.  Fermentative  metabolism,  which restricts energy generation to substrate-level phos-phorylation, is energetically ineficient; however, it probably provides yeast with a selective advantage compared with other cells dependent on oxidative growth since glycolytic rates in Crabtree-positive cells are very high. Under these conditions, yeast cells  are  able  to  satisfy  their  requirements  for energy and carbon whilst rapidly depleting carbon nutrients to the detriment of potential competitors. Wort presents yeast with a complex mixture of assimilable sugars. Maltose is typically the most abundant, with smaller concentrations of others including  glucose,  fructose,  sucrose,  and  the polymers of maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetrose. Uptake of sugars during fermentation is an ordered process in which the bulk sugar maltose is not used until supplies of sucrose, fructose, and glucose are exhausted. This is explained in that glucose (and the related fructose) is the preferred carbon source for S. cerevisiae, and its presence triggers wide-ranging metabolic shifts in which respiratory functions are switched off, as are the uptake and metabolism of other less-preferred carbon sources. This response is independent of and overrides the presence of oxygen (Broach, 2012). The effect has practical ramifications for modern commercial brewing. The use of high proportions of glucose adjuncts will delay maltose uptake, as will prolonged collection times for high-capacity vessels and in continuous
fermentation systems.
In terms of signal transduction, the specific effect of glucose acts via a target protein, one of a family of kinases termed snf1/AMPK (sucrose non-ferment-ing 1/AMP kinase). Predictably, the participation of AMP is indicative that these kinases are involved in  sensing  energy  status  (Hardie,  2011).  SnfA is a kinase that sits within a complex signalling pathway responsive to changing glucose concen-trations, in which metabolism is directed towards eliciting responses associated with repression or

derepression as well as inhibiting assimilation of other less preferred carbon sources. Kinase activity allows activation and deactivation responses that are exerted at the level of transcription, such that activation of SnfA by glucose exhaustion causes de-repression of genes required for the assimilation of non-glucose carbon sources as well as activation of pathways for respiration and accumulation of glycogen via gluconeogenesis. It is part of a trimeric protein complex, termed SNF1, which contains the kinase, Snf1, a regulatory subunit Snf4, and a third subunit coded for by three genes, GAL83, SIP1 and SIP2. The Snf4 moiety serves to maintain Snf1 activ-ity by preventing autoinhibition. In yeast, glucose exhaustion results in an increase in ADP concentra-tion and the latter binds to Snf4 and the resulting conformational change maintains Snf1 activity. The third subunit regulates the intracellular location of Snf1 activity. Where glucose concentrations are high, all activity is located in the cytosol. However, where glucose is limiting different subcomplexes adopt specific locations; Gal83 and Snf1 Gal83, the β-subunit of SNF1 kinase promotes transfer of the latter to the nucleus. Those associated with Sip1 and Sip2 transfer to the vacuolar membrane and cytosol, respectively. In this way, the various cellular responses associated with the glucose trigger can be mediated (for a fuller explanation see Conrad et al., 2014).
Rapid  maltose  uptake  by  brewing  yeast  is essential  for  eficient  conversion  of  extract  to ethanol. Brewing strains possess a multiplicity of transporters, each with differing specificity. Up to five MAL loci are present, each comprising three genes; MALx1 and MALx2 code for a transporter and hydrolysing enzymes, respectively, and MALx3 produces a promoter essential for eficient tran-scription of the other two (Charron et al., 1989). The  Mal  system  appears  relatively  specific  for maltose and turanose. MPH2 and MPH3 (maltose permease homologue) may also be present and these have a wider specificity transporting maltose, maltotriose, α-methylglucoside, and turanose. In some strains, an alternative transporter to MALx1 is present, coded for by AGT1 (α-glucosidase trans-porter), which, in addition to the sugars named already, will also transport trehalose and sucrose (Salema-Oom et al., 2005). Another gene, MTT1 (MTY1), apparently produces a transporter with a higher afinity for maltotriose than maltose.

Eficient utilization of the maltotriose in late fer-mentation is obviously an important consideration in commercial brewing since in many malt worts it is the third most abundant fermentable sugar present. Ale strains apparently utilize maltotriose less well as compared with lager types. Uptake of both maltose and maltotriose are rate-limiting in terms of fermentation rates, with maltotriose being assimilated more slowly than maltose. Vidgren et al. (2005) investigated maltose uptake by both lager and ale strains. They concluded that lager strains  predominantly  used  transporters  coded by the MALx1 genes whereas in ale strains those produced by AGT1 genes were more important. Once  in  the  cell,  maltose  and  maltotriose  are hydrolysed to α-d-glucose which can then enter glycolysis. Vidgren et al. (2010), reported that lager strains were more eficient at transporting maltose at low temperatures compared with ale strains, and that this correlated with differential temperature dependence of the Mtt1 transporters. The authors postulate that this may explain the different abilities of the two groups of brewing strains to ferment at different temperatures.
Surprisingly, there are few reports in the litera-ture as to the potential of maltose and other sugars to produce the same repressive effects as glucose. In an early report (Gancedo, 1992), repression is reported for mannose and fructose and to a lesser extent galactose and maltose. The differential effect was reported as either a result of all sugars exerting the same effects on target genes or glucose influenc-ing a greater number of target genes compared with the less effective sugars such as maltose. The report included a description of mutant studies, which showed the presence in MAL genes of a binding site for the regulatory protein, Mig1, known to be implicated in glucose repression. Of course, in the case of brewing fermentation using typical all-malt worts, exhaustion of oxygen would normally occur before glucose, which would preclude development of respiratory capacity. However, little information seems to be available describing the regulatory effects of sugars in mid-fermentation under anaero-bic conditions. Some unexpected effects of sudden exposure of yeast to high maltose concentrations have been reported. In the phenomenon termed ‘maltose-accelerated death’ (Postma et al., 1990) it was reported that in chemostat glucose-limited

aerobic  cultures,  sudden  exposure  to  maltose resulted in extensive cell death and lysis. In a similar study, Jansen et al. (2004) confirmed the effect of maltose but noted that with time variants that had lost the hypersensitivity and had an increased afin-ity for maltose could be selected for. Presumably, both of these effects would be of relevance in terms of attempts to isolate strains with improved prop-erties for very-high-gravity brewing. In addition, it may be a point to consider where sugar feeding regimes are used to alleviate osmotic stress in high-gravity brewing.
Global responses to sugars involve two signalling systems  in  which  glucose  stimulates  fermenta-tion and cell proliferation and represses responses associated with stress resistance and reserve carbo-hydrate accumulation. Responses are mediated by a cyclic AMP protein kinase pathway (cAMP-PKA). The same response is also elicited by the presence or absence of other essential nutrients (Conrad et al., 2014). Activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway requires glucose to invoke two responses, one extra-cellular and the other intracellular, both involving G-proteins. The extracellular system senses glucose concentration outside the cell. The intracellular system requires metabolism of glucose via glyco-lysis in which an intermediate, possibly at the level of phosphofructokinase, is implicated. The conse-quence of both signalling systems is stimulation of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cdc25, which in turn activates the GTPases, Ras1 and/or Ras2. The Ras enzymes produce cyclic AMP and this activates protein kinase A (PKA). The latter has multiple sites for activation and deactivation, which together allow transmission of the nutrient signal to be coupled to regulation of cellular processes such as acquisition of stress tolerance, growth, and proliferation  (Thevelein  and  de  Winde,  1999). The Ras proteins are widely conserved in many cell types and their absence in yeast represents a lethal mutation, which is reversed in other mutants where the cAMP dependence of PKA activation is missing. Interestingly, there is another layer of regulation depending on the intracellular localiza-tion of the cAMP-PKA system. Depending on the carbon source and environmental conditions, this may be primarily at the plasma membrane but also internal membranes in the mitochondria, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum.

Yeast growth and nitrogen assimilation during fermentation
Although glucose can apparently initiate the shift from quiescence, a complete nutrient medium is required for growth proper to begin. In addition to sources of carbon, the nitrogen component of wort has great importance in terms of influencing both yeast growth extent and the development of yeast-derived flavour compounds. The regulation of nitrogen assimilation and utilization is very com-plex, as would be expected for nutrients that form the building blocks of proteins, notably enzymes, molecules with catalytic activities. Several signal-ling pathways appear to be involved, which work in parallel and in concert with each other in order to regulate nitrogen assimilation.
Uptake and utilization of wort amino nitrogen during brewery fermentation is an ordered process and by convention four classes (A–D) of amino acids are recognized based on ease and order of assimilation. Amino acids used first include gluta-mate, glutamine, aspartate, lysine and serine (Class A),  followed  by  isoleucine,  valine,  leucine  and methionine (Class B). Although ammonia is a pre-ferred nitrogen source for Saccharomyces yeasts, it is not assimilated until mid to late fermentation (Class C),  together  with  alanine,  glycine,  tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. The imino acid proline is the sole member of Class D (Pierce 1987). More recent  studies  confirm  these  findings,  although with some strain-specific variability (Gibson et al., 2009). The timing of uptake of amino acids has importance for beer flavour since they are precur-sors in the synthesis of higher alcohols and vicinal diketones (Boulton and Quain, 2001). Proline, in combination with haze-forming polyphenols, is of importance to beer colloidal stability and because its catabolism requires molecular oxygen it is held that it is not assimilated in brewery fermentation to any great degree. This is not entirely the case as demonstrated in Gibson et al. (2009), perhaps suggesting that some strains might produce a more colloidally stable beer than others.
The observed patterns of amino acid assimilation are a consequence of the complexity and regulation of families of transporters of both high and low afin-ity with differing substrate specificity. Among these, at least 12 constitutive and four nitrogen-repressible transporters have been identified and, in addition, a general amino acid permease (Gap1) is present that

shows wide specificity (Horák, 1997). Regulation of the transporter systems depends upon the con-centrations and spectrum of amino acids present in the medium, and operates by repression of those less preferred by the presence of preferred sources of nitrogen. Gap1 appears to be active only under conditions of nitrogen starvation (Stanbrough and Magasanik, 1995). Regulation occurs at the level of translation (nitrogen catabolite repression) and by post-translational modification (nitrogen catabolite inactivation) as discussed subsequently.
In  eukaryotes,  including  yeast,  a  nitrogen-responsive  signal  transduction  mechanism,  the TOR (so-called ‘target of Rapamycin’) system has been elucidated. Rapamycin is a bacterial antifun-gal agent whose ability to prevent growth in many cell types, including those of human tumours in a manner that appeared very similar to passage into
G0, prompted research into its mode of action.
Rapamycin growth inhibition was shown to involve a set of kinases that regulate cellular growth in response to nutrient signals. The system sits at the heart of a signalling network and comprises in yeast two large protein complexes termed TOR1 and TOR2 only the first of which is Rapamycin sensitive (Loewith et al., 2002). The TOR1 system can contain both TORC1 and TORC2 complexes, whereas TOR2 contains only TORC2 proteins. TORC1 is considered to regulate cellular growth, possibly in response to external nutrient signals, and the second to control the spatial aspects of cellular polarity associated with growth (Virgilio and Loewith, 2006). The mechanism by which a response to the concentrations of external nutrients operates is not yet fully understood. Conrad et al. (2014) suggest that instead the primary signal may be derived from sensing the intracellular nitrogen content of the vacuole. In the same review, the authors ascribe the functions of TORC1, based on the effects of its inactivation, as influencing protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, transcription, cell cycle, meiosis, nutrient uptake, and autophagy. The functions of TORC2 include actin cytoskeleton organization, endocytosis, lipid synthesis, and cell survival.
Bearing in mind these global effects, it is perhaps no surprise that there may be linkages between signal transduction via the RAS and TOR systems (Schmelzle et al., 2004). The identification of cel-lular processes responsive to the TOR system have
12 |  Boulton


been probed via identifying the targets of phospho-rylation (Huber et al., 2009; Soulard et al., 2010). Such studies have shown that the TOR system exerts its influence at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. The regulation of both sugar and nitrogen metabolism as well as other metabolic pathways  has  been  implicated.  With  regard  to regulation of glycolysis, the pivotal role of phospho-fructokinase has long been recognized. Modulation of its activity via allosteric interactions by as many as 20 metabolites has been reported (Sols, 1981). These  include  ATP,  AMP,  citrate,  and  fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. It has now been demonstrated that subunits of the enzyme are phosphorylated in a TOR-dependent manner. Thevelein (2015) has suggested that yeast possess a receptor system used as a sensor of external glucose concentration, which in conjunction with an internal glucose sensor is used to regulate the RAS system. He suggests that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a potent activator of the RAS system and control of the concentration of this metabolite via interactions with RAS underpin the observed rapid glycolytic rates characteristic of Crabtree-positive yeast cells and, by inference, cancer cells.
Based  on  TOR-dependent  phosphorylation, several other putative roles for metabolic regulation via this system in yeast have been proposed. The cellular processes involved include control of glu-coneogenesis and reserve metabolism via glycogen

and trehalose (the latter also presumably being part of a stress response), control of adenylate energy charge, lipid accumulation including sterols, amino acid biosynthesis, folate metabolism, and purine and pyrimidine synthesis (summarized in Table 1.1). Of course, all of these processes are of critical importance to the performance of yeast in brewing fermentation.
In summary, the TOR system is inhibited by conditions that preclude growth. These include starvation and the application of stresses. Con-versely, under growth-permitting conditions the TOR system is activated and via its multitude actions mediates passage from quiescence to bio-mass formation.
The subcellular localization of the TOR system in yeast has importance. The evidence suggests that it is located on the external surface of the tonoplast, the vacuolar membrane (De Viriglio and Loewith, 2006). This is perhaps predictable since this orga-nelle occupies a crossroads, acting as the site for turnover and breakdown of many macromolecules, and storage of their component parts ready for re-use when required (Klionsky et al., 1990). For these reasons, the vacuoles contain high concentra-tions of many metabolites, including phosphate and amino acids. Yeast vacuoles are highly plastic and the size and number undergo large changes under  different  physiological  conditions.  Under starvation or stress conditions, the total vacuosome

is  increased;  for  example  in,  very-high-gravity fermentation (Pratt et al., 2012). It is suggested that the linkage between the vacuolar membranes, intracellular protein traficking membrane systems such  as  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  and  Golgi body, and the plasma membrane allow the TOR system to respond to metabolic cues such as amino acid concentrations in the vacuoles and external medium and manipulate metabolism according to need (Rohde et al., 2008).
TORC2 has received less attention compared with TORC2, largely because its insensitivity to rapamycin has meant more conventional but less tractable mutant studies have had to be used to elucidate its physiological roles. It appears that, as opposed to the regulation of growth by TORC1 in  response  to  nutrient  availability,  TORC2  is involved in the control of cell division via the cell cycle-dependent polarization of the actin cytoskel-eton (Schmidt et al., 1996). Other functions have also been ascribed to TORC2, including regulation of sphingolipid synthesis and the related ceramides (Powers et al., 2010). Sphingolipids are membrane-associated  and  appear  to  have  several  cellular roles, which include extracellular signal receptors, intracellular  protein  traficking,  and  cell  cycle regulation. In addition, they appear involved in the formation of eisomes, protein bodies found close to the plasma membrane and implicated in the early stages of endocytosis (Cowart and Obeid, 2008). A key role of TORC2 is to respond to external stresses that could compromise membrane struc-ture and function. A TORC2-dependent protein kinase, Ypk1 has been shown to control membrane lipid content in response to stresses such as heat. Ypk1 activity up-regulates the synthesis of sphin-golipid precursors by alleviating negative control of l-serine:palmitoyl-CoA transferase (Muir et al., 2014).
Nitrogen catabolite repression acts, as the name suggests, at the transcription level. In the presence of preferred nitrogen sources such as ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine, the genes required for the utilization of less preferred nitrogen sources are repressed. The mechanism by which the effects are exerted involve transcription activators, whose activities are regulated depending on their intracel-lular location; thus, repression of genes required for the assimilation of less preferred nitrogen sources

is inhibited only if the transcription activators are moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. One such key transcription activator, Gln3, is retained in the cytoplasm under nitrogen-rich conditions as a result of it binding to a protein designated Ure2 (Blinder et al., 1996). Under conditions of nitrogen starvation, the binding is reversed and Gln3,  together  with  another  transcription  acti-vator Gat1, migrate to the nucleus and activate transcription of the genes sensitive to nitrogen catabolite repression. Since the relocation to the nucleus  occurs  after  treatment  with  rapamycin, the involvement of TORC1 is suggested, acting as a mediator of the phosphorylation state of Gln3, which in turn controls complexing with Ure2. This appears to be so; however, the presence of other non-rapamycin-sensitive routes for the control of Gln3/Ure1 complexing has led to the suggestion that there is probably another non-TORC1 parallel signalling pathway involved in nitrogen catabolite repression (Rai et al., 2013). Yeast cells possess a retrograde signalling pathway so-called because it transmits signals from mitochondria to the nucleus, the reverse of the normal direction (Butow and Avadhani, 2004). The pathway controls adaptions in both carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism in response to mitochondrial dysfunction in which the TOR system is implicated (see ‘Roles of mito-chondria’, below, for more discussion).
Under conditions of nitrogen starvation (and other stress conditions), the general amino acid control pathway is up-regulated (Straschke et al., 2010). This is yet another example of transcriptional control in response to extracellular cues, in this case, inhibition of amino acid synthetic pathways as means of conserving available resources. The system operates via a transcription initiation factor, elF2 whose active form comprises a ternary com-plex of elF2, GTP and methionyl initiator tRNA. Under conditions of amino acid starvation, levels of tRNA increase and via a phosphorylation event this precipitates inhibition of the formation of the active GTP-bound form of elF2. Reduction in the concentration of activated elF2 reduces the rate of translation of messenger RNA, decreasing the rate of amino acid synthesis. The pathway is linked to the TORC1-driven intracellular amino acid sensing pathway and glucose sensing via Snf1. In the latter case, the genes coding for pathways involved in
14 |  Boulton


ribosome formation are down-regulated (Simpson and Ashe, 2012).

Fermentation growth medium-induced pathway
Yeast growth in brewery fermentation proceeds under conditions of repression as a result of the high sugar concentration. The repressive effects appear to be mediated principally via the activity of targets of PKA. In the exponential phase of growth, as discussed previously, the system is down-regulated and the phenotype is one of low-stress resistance (thinner cell wall, low reserves of trehalose and glycogen, down-regulation of stress-related genes). Under these conditions, exhaustion of an essential nutrient, most likely nitrogen in the case of beer
fermentations, causes immediate transition into G0.
The targets of PKA are up-regulated and the afore-mentioned phenotypic changes are reversed. The fact that the same relationship between PKA and growth on non-repressing carbon sources is absent has led to the suggestion that a specific fermentation growth medium signalling pathway (FMG) exists, which is entered whenever there is a complete growth medium containing repressing concentra-tions of glucose, or a similar carbon source. Thus, there is a common pathway that can be activated by one of a number of essential nutrients. Based on the fact that mutants lacking the regulatory subunit of PKA show the same response, it is considered inde-pendent of this kinase but working in parallel with the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway (Conrad et al., 2014). Activation of the FMG pathway requires activation of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK). It has been demonstrated that activation of FMG by provision of nitrogen to a glucose-containing medium requires the presence of another protein kinase, termed Sch9, which in turn regulates the activity of cAPK (Crauwells et al., 1997). Sch9 is itself a target for phosphorylation by TORC1 (Urban et al., 2007); in addition, it appears to act directly as an inhibitor of PKA (Zhang et al., 2011), indicating at least dual functions.


Response of yeast to oxygen
The practice of serial repitching of brewing yeast is responsible for the requirement to add oxygen to wort. Oxygen is considered to be required for syn-thesis of sterols and unsaturated fatty acids, both

essential  components  of  the  plasma  membrane (Boulton and Quain, 2001). These lipids are syn-thesized in the aerobic phase of fermentation and become diluted among daughter cells in subsequent growth. The quantity of oxygen supplied is one of the factors that regulate growth extent and this, in conjunction with the pitching rate and attempera-tion, are the major variables used to control brewery fermentations.  Oxygen  requirements  for  lipid synthesis are relatively modest, theoretically much more for sterol synthesis compared to unsaturated fatty acids, and it is likely that more is added to wort than is actually required. This prompts the question as to what is the fate of the excess?
Oxygen can function as both substrate and signal-ling molecule. Its presence or absence has effects at the genome level, although perhaps less than might be imagined. Based on chemostat studies under conditions of glucose-limitation, Ter Linde et al. (1999) observed that, of 6171 open reading frames, 5738  showed  detectable  transcripts.  Of  these, based on more than three times higher transcrip-tion levels, 219 showed elevated expression under aerobic conditions and 140 under anaerobic condi-tions. A further subset of genes are up-regulated under hypoxic conditions where oxygen is limiting (Deckert et al., 1995). The presence of these genes would be predicted in that it makes sense that cells would possess systems allowing eficient utilization of oxygen when supplies are restricted. It might be supposed that hypoxia is important for facultative anaerobes such as S. cerevisiae, since in the wild this condition would be expected to be more common than absolute anaerobiosis. Hypoxic genes include those coding for oxygen-requiring pathways, such as sterol synthesis and sterol uptake, and isoforms of aerobic enzymes, including those involved in respiration and mitochondrial ATP translocation. Two groups of genes are recognized; those with an aerobic counterpart are repressed at all but very low oxygen concentration (<0.5μM), and a second subset are active under all oxygen concentrations but activity is stimulated under hypoxic conditions (Becerra et al., 2002; Zitomer et al., 1997; Poyton, 1999).  There  are  further  complications  since aerobic metabolism has the potential to generate harmful reactive oxygen species and the cell must have mechanisms to deal with these (Morades-Ferreira and Costa, 2000) (for further discussion of oxidative stress in yeast, see Chapter 2).
Physiological Responses of Yeast to the Brewing Process |  15


The response to oxygen requires the existence of a sensing system and the evidence suggests that haem is implicated (Kwast et al., 1999) although sterols  have  also  been  proposed  (Davies  and Rine, 2006), both based on the fact that oxygen is required for synthesis and therefore their intracel-lular concentrations would be expected to vary in relation to available oxygen levels. In the case of haem, the enzymes for the whole of the synthetic pathway are present under anaerobic conditions (Labbe-Bois and Labbe, 1990). The ROXI gene had been shown to produce a haem-induced repressor of yeast hypoxic genes, which exerts its effect by generating a product that binds to the promoter region of receptive genes (Deckert et al., 1995). An additional haem-responsive factor, Hap1, activates the expression of genes involved in respiratory func-tions. As oxygen levels fall, there is a concomitant reduction in levels of Rox 1 and hypoxic genes are up-regulated. Other mechanisms exist and some of these appear to be related to sterol metabolism. An element, Upc2p, has been identified (Davis and Rine, 2006) that is involved in the regulation of around a third of anaerobically expressed genes. Levels of Upc2p are linked to sterol depletion and, by implication, available oxygen.
Yeast cells respond to exogenous sterol levels in a complex fashion, which is linked to oxygen availability. Under aerobic conditions, sterols are not assimilated, a process termed aerobic sterol exclusion (Rodriguez et al., 1985). This apparently is a result of transcriptional inhibition of the sterol uptake system in which ROX1 may be implicated (Rosenfeld and Beauvoit, 2003).
The  response  of  anaerobically  grown  yeast to oxygen is complex, much more so than the simple relationship between oxygen, sterols, and unsaturated fatty acids would suggest (Snoek and Steensma,  2007).  The  requirement  for  oxygen for  growth  can  be  satisfied  by  supplementing growth media with sterols and unsaturated fatty acids; however, it has been observed that addition of oxygen at stationary phase to such a medium increases specific fermentation rate, shortens fer-mentation cycle time, and increases the viability of the crop (Rosenfeld et al., 2003). The stimulation was linked to further sterol synthesis. Kwast et al. (2003) provided a description of putative roles of various classes of genes known to be induced under anaerobic conditions. Out of a total of 346

genes, 42 were related to the cell wall, 35 to cellular stress responses, 31 to carbohydrate metabolism, and 28 to the metabolism of lipids, fatty acids, and isoprenoids. In addition, several others coded for enzymes to which there was an aerobically induced isoform. In addition to the haem biosynthetic path-way, anaerobic yeast contain all the enzymes for sterol synthesis. Clearly, neither of these pathways can be active under such conditions, but it does suggest that the cell is primed in such a way that very rapid mobilization will occur should oxygen become available. This is in agreement with the observation  that  anaerobic  yeast  contains  high levels of squalene, the last step in the non-oxygen requiring sterol biosynthetic pathway, and therefore the pool of this metabolite primes sterol formation should oxygen become available (Jahnke and Klein, 1983). If this is so, it follows that lipid synthesis could proceed in cropped pitching yeast, providing oxygen is supplied. This has been shown to be the case (Boulton et al., 2000; Verbelen et al., 2009). In the work described, oxygenation of concentrated pitching yeast slurries suspended in beer was car-ried out, care being taken to ensure that exposure to oxygen during handling was minimized. At a temperature of 20°C, both sterols and unsaturated fatty acids were synthesized, maximum concentra-tions being achieved after 6–8h. The process also resulted in loss of glycogen. In the latter study, it was shown that trehalose levels increased and the yeast acquired resistance to oxidative stress, based on the up-regulation of genes know to be implicated in these processes. Acquisition of stress resistance occurred after 45–60 min.
On a mass balance basis, the quantity of oxygen used for sterol and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis is small. The conversion of a molecule of squalene to ergosterol requires 12 molecules of oxygen. In the case of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, desatu-ration of one molecule of a fatty acid requires just a single molecule of oxygen. The total quantity of sterols in yeast never exceeds around 1% of the dry weight and under brewing conditions is much less (Parks and Casey, 1995). For growth under anaero-bic conditions, no more than 5mg/l is required (Aries and Kirsop, 1978). Unsaturated fatty acids are more abundant than sterols by approximately 5-fold (Rogers et al., 1974). In addition to the requirement for oxygen, yeast cells decrease the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids as a

means of maintaining membrane fluidity at lower temperature; however, not all strains have an equal facility for this (Torija et al., 2003; Beltran et al., 2008; Tronchoni et al., 2012). Although performed largely with oenological yeast strains, these studies possibly suggest that this is implicated in the ability of lager strains to grow at lower temperatures than ale types.
Under  aerobic  de-repressing  conditions,  the majority of oxygen is used by yeast as the terminal electron  acceptor  in  oxidative  phosphorylation. Under repressing conditions, yeast has an afinity for oxygen in excess of that required for sterol and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, which prompts the question as to its role. Rosenfeld and Beauvoit (2003) reported a cyanide-resistant oxygen uptake by anaerobic yeast but concluded that this was not due to a functional respiratory chain since it could be observed in both rho+  (wild-type) and rho– (petite mutant) cells grown under anaerobic conditions. The authors suggest that synthesis of haem (2.5 molecules of oxygen per molecule), sterol,  and  unsaturated  fatty  acids  account  for some  of  this.  Other  oxygen-requiring  pathways include the syntheses of nicotinic acid from tryp-tophan and ubiquinone in a pathway whose early stages are common to that used for sterol forma-tion. The Ferri-reductase system features a plasma membrane oxidase used for high-afinity uptake of ferric ions and a mitochondrial l-proline oxidase, which is repressed under anaerobiosis but induced by proline. Interestingly, in oenological fermenta-tions proline is rapidly metabolized in response to provision of oxygen at the end of the growth phase, presumably when the glucose and nitrogen repres-sion signals are absent (Salmon and Barre, 1998).

Roles of mitochondria
In anaerobically grown yeast mitochondria adopt an  undeveloped  form  termed  promitochondria. Under non-repressing aerobic conditions these can rapidly adopt a fully functional form (Plattner et al., 1970). Visser et al. (1995) noted that under aerobic de-repressed conditions there were numerous small mitochondria, whereas under glucose repression they became much fewer in number but these were larger and branched. The total mitochondriome was similar in each case. Conversely, working with sake yeast, Kitagaki et al. (2013) developed procedures to monitor mitochondrial morphology throughout

fermentation. They noted that initially the orga-nelles had a filamentous tubular structure and as the fermentation progressed these fragmented and became smaller and non-elongated. Rosenfeld et al. (2004) isolated mitochondria from anaerobically grown, repressed yeast cells and reported that they could detect the presence of cyanide-sensitive and non-phosphorylating  NADH-dependent  oxygen consumption   but   no   antimycin-A-dependent, NADH- or NADPH-dependent oxidase activities and thus they concluded that oxygen consumption by anaerobic mitochondria was negligible. Despite the apparent differences in some reports, the con-sensus is that the mitochondria are highly dynamic in shape and size and that processes of both fusion and division are of frequent occurrence (Jensen et al., 2000).
The  role  of  mitochondria  in  brewing  yeast under brewing conditions is uncertain; however, it is known that petites produce unsatisfactory fermentation performance, notably slower rates, prolonged vicinal diketone (VDK) stand times, and altered flocculation characteristics (Ernandes et al., 1993). The negative effects on VDK metabo-lism are perhaps unsurprising, since this organelle is the site of key parts of the ILV pathway in which branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine are synthesized (Kohlhaw, 2003). In modern brewing practice, where large batch sizes and very concentrated worts are commonly used, the increased frequency of occurrence of petites has been observed and ascribed to elevated stress levels associated with these processes (Jenkins et al., 2009; Lawrence et al., 2012, 2013). The qui-escent daughter cells produced during the diauxic shift phase discussed earlier (see section ‘Quies-cent yeast cells’) inherit only highly functional mitochondria  during  the  asymmetrical  division (Peraza-Hayes et al., 2010; McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2011). Under these conditions, where oxygen is present the quiescent cells adopt a respiratory metabolism and maintain their elevated levels of glycogen and trehalose. The non-quiescent cell frac-tion retains a repressed metabolism and continues to deplete carbohydrate reserves via glycolysis. This helps to explain the relative differences in longevity between the quiescent and non-quiescent pheno-types under non-growth-permitting conditions.
Interestingly,  mitochondria  seemingly  have  a role in sterol uptake and transport in anaerobically
Physiological Responses of Yeast to the Brewing Process |  17


grown yeast. Reiner et al. (2006) used a range of yeast mutants that were unable to grow under anaerobic conditions. They observed that the larg-est group of mutants, which were not able to take up exogenous sterols, had disruptions of genes known  to  have  mitochondrial  functions.  These roles for mitochondria are perhaps unsurprising, since this organelle is the site of several biosynthetic pathways. These include part of those for sterol syn-thesis, branched-chain amino acids, and the citric acid cycle (Shimizu et al., 1973; Ryan and Kohlhaw, 1974; Jauniaux, 1978). Based on the inhibition of the ADP/ATP transporter by bongkrekic acid, Visser et al. (1994) proposed that the energy to fuel these pathways must be derived from substrate-level phosphorylation. In one of the few studies using a brewing yeast strain, Samp (2012) reported that in lager strains there was a link between mitochondrial
function and SO2 production. Respiratory deficient
mutants showed reduced conversion rates of sulfate to sulfite compared with the wild type. Conditions that favoured cardiolipin synthesis, an important mitochondrial membrane lipid, also resulted in reduced sulfite.
Mitochondria play a role in apoptosis in yeast. This is the phenomenon of self-programmed sui-cide. Programmed cell death can occur in response to exposure to external stimuli, such as hydrogen peroxide or acetic acid, and via internal cues, such as cell ageing. In a unicellular organism, such as yeast, it may represent an altruistic cooperative phenomenon whereby unfit cells are eliminated from the population and/or subpopulations are selected that possess enhanced properties, such as improved resistance to external stresses. Several apoptotic pathways have been described and some suicidal processes are mediated by mitochondria. Regulation may involve major signalling pathways, such as Ras and TOR, which serve to link the pro-cess to inputs from ageing and nutritional status. A group of proteases termed caspases are involved in the signalling process, and the outward manifesta-tions of mitochondrial involvement are release into the cytosol of cytochrome C and nucleases that migrate to the nucleus and once there disrupt DNA and reactive oxygen species (Peirera et al., 2008). Of course, in the case of yeast subjected to the condi-tions encountered in brewing, the putative roles of mitochondria in apoptosis are less apparent, since these organelles never become fully developed. For

example, Madeo et al. (1999) reported that oxygen radicals played an essential role in apoptosis, since conditions that resulted in their depletion, such as anaerobiosis, prevented apoptosis. Conversely, in another study (Aerts et al., 2008) a mutant yeast strain  with  a  much  shorter  chronological  lifes-pan compared to the wild type was shown, when growing aerobically, to exhibit increased rates of apoptosis and to have dysfunctional mitochondria.


Cell wall plasticity
The yeast cell wall confers shape and has a protec-tive function, providing resistance to mechanical and osmotic stresses. Apart from providing the location for receptors and targets for flocculation, the porosity of the outer protein layer limits entry of larger molecules, such as enzymes that might damage the more fragile plasma membrane (Klis et al., 2002; Free, 2013). The wall must be capable of responding to the requirements of cellular growth and proliferation, and conversely adopt a more rigid protective form under non-growth-permitting con-ditions. It follows that systems must be available for sensing cell wall structure and making appropriate adjustments in response to signals from the central metabolic pathways. Based on whole-cell transcrip-tion studies, some 1200 genes have been implicated in cell wall-related functions, demonstrating how regulation in the structure of this organelle is inte-gral to physiological responses of the cell to the environment (De Groot et al., 2001). Comparisons of  stationary  phase  and  exponentially  growing walls show many differences. The former are less permeable,  show  different  protein  profiles,  and are more resistant to cell wall-degrading enzymes. Approximately a 6-fold increase in disulfide bridges in stationary phase cells has been observed (de Nobel et al., 1990). In addition to these changes, anaerobiosis is accompanied by altered levels of transcription of several genes involved in the pro-duction of cell wall proteins (Klis et al., 2006).
Remodelling of cell wall structure is accom-plished through the action of the cell wall integrity signalling pathway (Levin, 2011). A response to environmental stresses is sensed via a set of cell-wall-located receptors via a G-protein termed Rho1 (Ras-homologous family of GTPases). The same protein is also involved in the regulation of cell wall synthetic  reactions  associated  with  progression
18 |  Boulton


through the cell cycle. It follows that this process requires sensitivity to the internal cues driving budding. Rho1 coordinates a multitude of func-tions related to cell wall structure and biogenesis. These include coordination of synthesis of β-glucan at selected sites on the cell wall, the associated endocytosis of the necessary building materials, and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The cell response to the passage into quiescence, triggered by nutrient starvation and/or application of exter-nal stresses, is also mediated by the Rho1-directed signalling pathway (Levin, 2011). More recently, Rho1 has also been implicated in another signalling pathway in yeast involved in regulation of homeo-stasis of plasma membrane fluidity (Lockshon et al., 2012).
Rho1 is one of a family of six related GTPases that are found in S. cerevisiae, located at the surface of the plasma membrane. Two of these are essential, Rho as discussed and Cdc42, the latter being vital for establishment of cell polarity and bud formation. Proper function of the Rho system is dependent on correct location and orientation in the plasma mem-brane and on the activity of guanosine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins. The first of these transmit signals from cell-surface receptor proteins of the initiating stimulus (Radico and Heinisch, 2010). Somewhat fascinatingly, some of these sensors have been shown to possess rigid polypeptides that project into the periplasm and possibly the wall, where they may serve as linear nanosprings probing mechanical status (Dupres et al., 2009). Phosphoinositides have been shown to have importance in membrane functionality and it appears that part of this activity involves activation of the Rho sensors (Odorizzi et al., 2000).
Rho1 exerts its effects to the relevant parts of yeast metabolism via a MAP kinase cascade. An important component is the protein kinase, Pkc1,  which  is  itself  activated  by  GTP-bound Rho1 (Kamada et al., 1996). It constitutes one of five MAPK signalling pathways that regulate a multitude of critical cellular functions, which apart from the cell wall integrity sensing pathway include mating response, sporulation, and the mor-phological changes associated with transitions to pseudohyphal habits associated with those strains capable of this response (Gustin et al., 1998).

Flocculation
Flocculation, the non-sexual aggregation of cells to form clumps, is a key determinant of the suitability of brewing strains for use in brewing. The ability to flocculate in late fermentation assists with separat-ing the yeast crop from green beer. Strains that do not show this property to the appropriate degree lead to high cell counts in processes down-stream of fermentation, with concomitant high loss rates and ineficiencies in primary filtration. Conversely, highly  flocculant  strains  may  cause  premature separation and thereby increase the risk of stuck fermentation and poor VDK removal.
There is a relationship between sugar availability and the onset of flocculation. This makes perfect sense from the standpoint of yeast. When sugar is plentiful in early fermentation, flocculation is inhib-ited and this ensures good cell dispersion and equal access to carbon. When sugar becomes exhausted, flocculation can occur and from the standpoint of survival it is advantageous for cells to form flocs, which provide a sheltered environment for those in the interior.
Flocculation  is  a  cell-surface  phenomenon and therefore its expression is linked to cell wall structure. It has been established that flocculation involves interactions between lectin-like proteins (flocculins) and cell surface mannans. The former are present on all cells, whereas the flocculins only occur in those strains possessing the appropriate genotype. Calcium ions are required for floccula-tion to occur and it is thought that these mediate binding  by  causing  an  essential  conformation change on the lectin structure. Abundant wort sugars such as glucose and maltose preferentially bind to lectins and thereby inhibit the process. In addition to mannan–lectin interactions, floc sta-bilization may occur via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding (Soares, 2011). Two main phenotypes are recognized based on the patterns of inhibition by sugars. NewFlo types, which include many brewing strains, do not flocculate in the pres-ence of mannose, glucose, maltose, or sucrose. In Flo1 types, flocculation is inhibited by mannose. A rarer third type, M1, occurs in some strongly top-cropping ale strains and appears to operate via direct protein–protein interactions and does not occur in the absence of ethanol.
Physiological Responses of Yeast to the Brewing Process |  19


Flocculation is conferred by a number of FLO genes:  FLO1  and  its  alleles,  FLO2  and  FLO4, together with FLO5, FLO9, and FLO10, which show high homology to FLO1. Collectively, these are  responsible  for  the  Flo1  phenotype.  Lager strains alone possess another gene, lg-FLO1, which confers the NewFlo phenotype and codes for a flocculin that binds a broader range of sugars than Flo1 types (Verstrepen et al., 2003). Other genes are involved in the regulation of flocculation. The product of FLO8 is a transcriptional activator of FLO1 and another gene FLO11, which is impli-cated in a stress response in which in some strains’ growth becomes pseudohyphal (Bayly et al., 2005). Regulation of FLO11 is particularly complex and both transcriptional and post-translational mecha-nisms are recognized. Several signalling pathways are  involved  in  its  expression.  These  include  a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, cAMP protein kinase A pathway, and those involved in quorum sensing and nutritional status (Verstrepen and Klis, 2005). In NewFlo strains, flocculation is triggered when exponential growth ceases. Aside from exhaustion of sugars and the consequent avail-ability of Flo-mediated lectins, regulation involves metabolic activities in which nutrient-sensing path-ways via intracellular kinases control regulation of FLO genes.
Flocculation  requires  cell-to-cell  contact  to occur and it follows that mechanical agitation is important. Other factors, apart from the presence of sugars, are the concentrations and range of cati-ons, pH, temperature, oxygen, and ethanol. Some of these effects may be purely physical; for exam-ple, lower fermentation temperature will decrease natural  agitation  rates  and  therefore  lessen  the probability of cell-to-cell collision. Several cations (Ba2+, Sr2+ and Pb2+) inhibit flocculation, possibly by competing with calcium ions. Others, especially Mn2+  and Mg2+, promote flocculation. Optimum pH for flocculation is in the range pH 3.0–5.0 and is inhibited at wider ranging values. This explains the observation that acid washing of pitching yeast is accompanied by slurries adopting a more fluid, less viscous form. The presence of ethanol promotes flocculation by an unknown mechanism but possi-bly by its influence on cell hydrophobicity (Soares, 2011).
Flocculation impinges in two ways on the prac-tice of serial repitching. It has been observed that

older cells are more flocculent compared with those of a younger generational age, presumably a conse-quence of increased size of the latter and possibly linked to age-related changes in the cell surface, maybe the presence of greater concentrations of chitin  (Powell,  2003).  Changes  in  flocculation have also been linked to genetic instability. Some strains appear very stable in this regard, in others an abrupt shift from flocculant to non-flocculant has been observed in the course of serial repitch-ing. Thus, Powell and Diacetis (2007), working with two brewing strains, observed no changes in flocculence  behaviour  over  several  generations. Conversely, Sato et al. (2001) reported that, for a bottom-fermenting strain, loss of flocculence was the most commonly observed change and this was related to loss of the lg-FLO1 gene.


Reserve metabolism
Yeast, in common with other cells, must accumu-late reserve materials in times of plenty in order to increase the chances of survival through future periods of starvation. In brewing yeast cells, the presence of storage granules of lipids, phosphate (volutin), and glycogen can be observed. In addi-tion, the vacuolar space, the site for amino acid storage, increases significantly in volume during the latter phases of fermentation as a consequence of protein turnover associated with starvation.
Volutin granules comprise linear polyphosphate chains associated with a number of basic proteins (Jacobson et al., 1982). Phosphate regulation in yeast cells is complex, responding to the availability of exogenous phosphate but also linked to the con-trol of many cellular processes, including cell cycle control via the actions of Pho85, a cyclin-dependent kinase (Conrad et al., 2014). The latter report that downstream targets of Pho85 include expression of PHO genes, responsible for phosphate sensing and scavenging; Gen4 transcription factor, implicated in regulation of amino acid biosynthetic pathways; Cln3, a cyclin involved in cell cycle control; and Rim15, a protein kinase involved in nutrient sens-ing.
Lipid granules contain stores of both triacylg-lycerols and sterol esters, as well as enzyme systems involved in lipid accumulation and its breakdown and mobilization (Rajakumari et al., 2006). Alcohol acetyl transferase (Atf1p), the terminal enzyme of
20 |  Boulton


the acetate-forming pathway in yeast, is also local-ized in lipid particles (Verstrepen et al., 2004). This suggests a linkage between ester formation and lipid metabolism, most likely a mechanism for regulation of the supply of acetyl-CoA depending on the availability of oxygen. Three sterol hydro-lases, Tg1p, Yeh1p, and Yeh2p, have been detected in S. cerevisiae. These are implicated in liberation of free sterols from the esters, which are subsequently transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum for con-version to ergosterol, and from there incorporated into the plasma membrane (Wagner et al., 2009).
The major carbohydrate reserve materials are glycogen and trehalose, although as discussed later the latter also has important roles as a stress pro-tectant. In brewing yeast cropped from fermenter, glycogen may account for up to 40% of the cell dry weight and its presence can be easily detected by the brownish-red coloration formed when cells are stained with iodine. Mobilization of glycogen in the aerobic phase of fermentation provides energy and possibly some carbon for sterol synthesis (Quain and Tubb, 1982). Glycogen accumulates in yeast when one of several nutrients become limiting. These include carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and phos-phorus  (Lillie  and  Pringle,  1980).  In  addition, glycogen accumulation is also part of the general stress response. An important part of storage of brewing yeast in the intervals between cropping and repitching is to ensure that glycogen reserves are preserved. Glycogen is synthesized from UDP-glucose, itself derived from glucose-1-phosphate via  the  action  of  UDPG  pyrophosphorylase. Formation of the glycogen polymer involves the concerted activity of glycogenin, a self-glycosylating initiator protein, glycogen synthase, and a branch-ing enzyme. UDP-glucose is also a substrate for the synthesis of trehalose and cell wall β-glucans. A  signalling  pathway  controls  disbursement  of UDP-glucose  between  these  three  biosyntheses (Grose et al., 2007). A yeast kinase, Psk2p, has been shown to phosphorylate another protein, Ugp1p. This   event   regulates   intracellular   localization, either at the plasma membrane (phosphorylated) or the cytoplasm (dephosphorylated), and by this means supply of UDP-glucose for the syntheses of cell wall or glycogen, respectively (Wilson et al., 2010). Transcription of glycogen synthase is up-regulated at the end of the exponential phase of growth under the control of cAMP-dependent

protein kinase pathway. Post-translational controls also  occur  via  an  inactivating  phosphorylation. This can be alleviated by the presence of glucose-6-phosphate.  Formation  of  α-1–4  linkages  and α-1–6 branch points are formed by the concerted action of glycogen synthase and the branching enzyme  (1,4-α-glucan  branching  enzyme;  EC 2.4.1.18). Mobilization of glycogen is principally via  glycogen  phosphorylase  and  a  debranching enzyme [4-α-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) and amylo-α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33)].
Regulation   of   glycogen   accumulation   or mobilization   is   exceedingly   complex.   Several overlapping  signalling  pathways  appear  to  be involved. Deactivation or activation of the PKA pathway is accompanied by concomitant reduced or increased glycogen accumulation, respectively. The transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p, which are implicated in the general stress response, are involved. Phosphorylation of these controls cellular location between the nucleus, where transcription of sensitive genes may occur, or the cytoplasm. In addition, the SNF1 pathway, associated with glucose repression, the Pho85p kinase linked to phosphate metabolism and cell cycle control, and the TOR system all appear to feed into the control of  glycogen  accumulation  or  dissimilation  (see Wilson et al., 2010, for an excellent summary).
Part of the response to nutrient starvation is one, termed autophagy, in which cellular structures are re-ordered to improve the chances of survival. It  involves  the  capture  of  selected  cytoplasmic components in vesicles, which eventually fuse with the  vacuole  where  reprocessing  occurs  (Cebol-lero  and  Reggiori,  2009).  In  this  way,  cellular components are made available for recycling. The process is used to recycle damaged or excess orga-nelles and under normal growth conditions, the transfer of cytosolic components to the vacuole. The latter process is termed the cytosol-to-vacuole targeting (CVT) pathway. It involves enclosure of the selected cytosolic components in a newly synthesized   double-membrane-bound   structure called  the  autophagosome.  This  fuses  with  the tonoplast, eventually leading to the formation of an intravacuolar, single-membrane-bound vesicle, the autophagic body. The membrane of this is digested and the contents degraded. The process is completed when selected breakdown products are targeted and returned to the cytosol for recycling.
Physiological Responses of Yeast to the Brewing Process |  21


As might be expected, since nutrient limitation acts as a primary trigger in both, there is a link between  autophagy  and  glycogen  metabolism. They also share in common a spatial aspect. It is suggested that there are both cytosolic and vacu-olar glycogen pools and that transfer of some of the cytosolic pool to the vacuole is via the autophagy system. This application of cellular compartmen-talization is a strategy adopted by the cell to prevent glycogen breakdown at an inappropriate time by ensuring that it does not come into contact with the cytosolic glycogen phosphorylase (Wilson et al., 2010).
Trehalose  is  a  disaccharide  comprising  two molecules of glucose linked through a α-1–1 bond. The role of trehalose as a stress protectant, as well as reserve carbohydrate, is supported by the fact that elevated levels favour yeast survival in very-high-gravity fermentations and enhanced trehalose and improved ethanol tolerance have been shown to correlate in engineered bioethanol strains (Tao et al., 2012). Similar observations have been made in relation to active dried brewing yeast (Zheng et al., 2013). Trehalose exerts its stress-protecting role via its ability to stabilize membranes (Crowe et al., 1984).
Like glycogen, the trehalose content of cells is dependent on the balance between synthesis and degradation. Synthesis is via a UDP-glucose-dependent  trehalose  synthase  protein  complex coded by the genes TPS1 (trehalose 6-phosphate synthase) and TPS2 (trehalose 6-phosphate phos-phatase). Two further genes, TPS3 and TSL1, code for regulatory proteins. Trehalose degradation is via one of two trehalases, a neutral trehalase (NTH1) or an acid trehalase (ATH1), their names reflecting their pH optima for activity. A review of trehalose metabolism may be found in François and Parrou (2001). NTH1 appears to be used for mobilization of intracellular trehalose reserves, whereas ATH1 may be used for utilization of exogenous trehalose as a carbon source (Parrou et al., 2005).
In addition to these roles, trehalose functions as a regulator of glycolysis via the intermediary of trehalose-6-phosphate and the ability of this intermediate to act as an allosteric inhibitor of hexokinase. Thevelein and Hohmann (1995) sug-gest that trehalose-6-phosphate synthase occupies a key position at the beginning of multiple glucose signalling pathways.

Yeast responses to stress
A common thread that weaves throughout any discussion of brewing yeast physiology are the numerous  stresses  to  which  cells  are  subjected in the brewing process and the resultant cellular responses. Several of these are alluded to in earlier sections of this chapter. Several external stresses elicit  common  responses  as  evidenced  by  the observation that exposure to a non-lethal stress of one type provides a measure of resistance to others. By implication, common pathways are activated and these are triggered in response to one or more separate receptors. Genomic profiling studies have shown that approximately 900 genes respond to signals generated by the application of environ-mental stresses (Gasch et al., 2000). Activation of the stress response is mediated in part by the Ras cyclicAMP signalling pathway (Park et al., 2005). Both long-term transcriptional effects and short-term  post-translational  modifications  occur  by which the phenotype is adjusted to deal with the applied stress. Of key importance is the presence in the promoter region of a short DNA motif, termed STRE, to which transcription factors bind. The STRE element is found in the promoter region of more than 200 genes known to be implicated in the general stress response of yeast. This subject is not discussed further here since it is dealt with elsewhere in this book (see Chapter 2).


Future perspective
It will be apparent from the material covered in this chapter that yeast cells, in particular S. cerevisiae, have been subjected to intense study. Much of the elucidation of the breathtakingly elegant ways in which eukaryotic cells regulate all aspects of cellular function, from birth to self-programmed death, have been performed using this model cell. However, the results of very few of these studies can be used with any degree of certainty to interpret the behaviour of brewing yeast strains growing under brewing conditions. Thus, the combination of growth on an uncharacterized and variable but comparatively unbalanced  medium,  transient  aerobioisis,  and yeast recycling coupled to serial fermentation make for a fascinating but perhaps bewildering level of complexity. Nevertheless there are some important lessons to be learnt, which might be used profitably

in attempts to make brewing yeast behave in a pre-dictable and more productive manner.
In yeast, the signalling pathways that respond to external nutritional cues do so in a way that multi-ple nutrients can elicit a common set of responses. The pathways respond to the presence or absence of comparatively simple molecules. Since brewers have yeast ready to pitch in storage vessels, it may be possible to use this as an opportunity to initiate key pathways before pitching has occurred and thereby shorten lag times, improve the performance of newly propagated cultures, remodel the phenotype to a state that is more amenable for very-high-grav-ity brewing, or simply provide methods for more precise control of the formation of yeast-derived beer flavour metabolites.
An aspect of yeast activity that is not usually considered in normal brewing practice is that of population heterogeneity. For obvious reasons, it is usual to deal with yeast in bulk and by inference there is a tacit assumption that all cells present within that population will behave in a similar fash-ion. Clearly this is incorrect. The understanding of the relationships between cell age and size and the risks of selection of an inappropriate portion of a bottom crop from fermenter are well-known. It is certain that yeast populations are inherently het-erogeneous and there is some evidence that there is some degree of cooperation. The phenomenon of flocculation is considered to be a stress response in which cells within the inner parts of the cell mass are more likely to survive than those on the outside. This may be a purely random process, although it is possible that there is some element of choice in terms of which cells are selected for sacrifice or sur-vival based on their relative positions in the floc. As alluded to already, the phenomenon of apoptosis carries the assumption that members of a popula-tion are selected for death. Whether this requires input from all members of the population or it is simply a manifestation of the end of the lifespan of an individual unrelated to potential cooperative behaviour is not known.
It is a sobering thought that the contents of a large fermenter represent an enormous number of individuals. A terminal count of 60 million cells/ml equates to a total of around 1×1016 cells at the end of growth in a 2000hl vessel. This compares with the total human population of the earth for 2015 of approximately 7×109. Assuming a pitching rate of


15 million cells/ml and initial and final viabilities of 95%, an additional 4.5×1014 dead cells would be present in the crop. Of course, this does not include any cells that would have disappeared via lysis or those that might be approaching senescence. Quorum sensing, the ability of microbial popula-tions to monitor cell densities, is a well-established phenomenon in bacteria. The evidence suggests that a similar system occurs in populations of S. cerevisiae and that the process uses aromatic alco-hols such as phenylethanol as signalling molecules (Zupan et al., 2013; Wuster and Babu, 2010). In another example, important beer esters such as ethyl acetate and ethyl hexanoate have been shown to function as fruit fly pheromones and by infer-ence may be involved in dispersing natural yeast populations (Siderhurst and Jang, 2006). A greater understanding of the biological basis of, for exam-ple, the formation of beer flavour compounds, is likely to lead to the development of more directed control procedures.

Abstract
A key performance indicator of brewing fermenta-tions is the capacity of the yeast to convert wort into the desired fermentate in an appropriate timescale. Balancing the needs of the brewer and the yeast is more complex than is always appreciated. Brewery fermentations can impose a variety of stresses on the yeast cell, particularly when conducted at scale, and this is exacerbated by the use of serial repitch-ing, in which the yeast is recycled to complete a  number  of  successive  fermentations.  Brewing yeast strains are routinely exposed to fluctuations in oxygen concentration and the accumulation of carbon dioxide, hyperosmotic stresses which are wort  gravity-dependent;  pH  downshifts  during fermentation, which can be extreme if acid wash-ing is applied between successive fermentations; accumulation of acetaldehyde, ethanol, and organic acids; nutrient abundance, imbalance, and scarcity; and temperature shifts from around 21°C to 2°C. This chapter will focus on some of the stresses that may be encountered during lager, ale, and where appropriate wheat beer fermentations conducted at scale.


The origins of brewing yeast
The majority of publications in the field have been focused on lager strains mainly because of the larger global volume associated with these beer styles. Although many of the observations concerning stress responses may also apply to ale and hefe ale yeast strains this is not always the case. One reason

for these differences is that lager yeast strains are genetically different from their ale and wheat yeast peers and in fact from each other. Lager yeast strains are interspecific hybrids (meaning hybrids from two different species) but the exact parentage had been a matter of debate (Kodama et al., 2005) (see Chapters 4 and 6). Originally a model involving hybridization of an ale strain of Saccharomycescerevi-siae with a strain of the genetically complex species, Saccharomyces  bayanus,  was  generally  accepted. However, lager yeast also appear to contain DNA not common to either parent (Rainieri et al., 2006; Nakao et al., 2009), suggesting genetic input from an unknown ‘parental species’. This remained a matter of much debate until the discovery of a new species, Saccharomyces eubayanus, which has been revealed to be an exact genetic match to the non-S. cerevisiae parent in the complex (Libkind et al., 2011). The species was discovered associated with Nothofagus (southern Beech) in the forests of Patagonia and unpublished reports suggest it is also found elsewhere in the world but many workers in the field of yeast ancestry and diversity believe this to be but one example habitat from which such spe-cies have been derived.
The hybrid condition of S. pastorianus (S. cer-evisiae×S. eubayanus) may be the reason for its psychrophilic nature, apparently inherited from the cold-tolerant S. eubayanus parent (Libkind et al., 2011). This characteristic has resulted in superior performance in the low-temperature environment of lager fermentations and confers resistance to cold during storage and yeast transfer in breweries.

Lager strains are categorized as Saaz and Froh-berg after the locations in Bohemia and Germany in which they were originally used. These two hybrid groups are used by modern brewers but are geneti-cally distinct from one another (Liti et al., 2005; Dunn and Sherlock, 2008).
Ale   brewing   predates   lager   brewing,   and although the yeast strains have been selected over time, their origins are less well documented or indeed studied. Ale strains belong to the species S. cerevisiae but strains can be really quite genetically distinct from one another.
Wheat beer yeast strains also belong to the species S. cerevisiae and are characterized by the occurrence of the PAD1 and FDC1 genes, encod-ing phylacrylic acid and ferulic acid decarboxylase, respectively. Both genes must be functional for the characteristic clove-like, phenolic character due to 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG) to be produced.

Brewing fermentations
Modern brewing practices used by global, regional, and  craft  brewers  are  essentially  derivatives  of those used in traditional, historical brewing. The late  nineteenth-century  innovations  concerning the concept of single-strain brewing and the use of propagation systems eclipsed the practice of contin-ual serial repitching. Although some breweries do practice this even today, they face the unintended consequences of hygiene issues and genetic drift of primary strains. Most global and regional brewers use propagation in specially designed vessels to ensure suficient inoculating biomass (pitch) of the desired brewing strain. Craft brewers tend to use dried yeast or yeast slurries acquired from Regional or Global neighbouring breweries. Yeast is propa-gated in wort under aerobic conditions, achieved through the addition of sterile air or oxygen (Boul-ton et al., 2000). For further discussion of yeast handling, see Chapter 3.
Following propagation, the fresh yeast slurry is transferred (pitched) into aerated or oxygenated wort in a cylindroconical (CC) fermentation vessel. For the most part, these vessels are vertically placed to alleviate footprint constraints but on occasion companies adopt a horizontal position for these vessels  presumably  to  reduce  hydrostatic  pres-sure impacts on some strains with the additional consequence of a modified ester (fruity) profile. CC fermenters may, or may not, be mixed using

pumped loop systems or internal agitators where appropriate, though this practice is relatively new to the sector. At the beginning of fermentation a brief lag phase occurs. This is partly caused by the
requirement for the yeast to exit from G0  of the
yeast cell cycle and commence replication, but is also a consequence of the adjustment of the cells to changes in the nutrient, gaseous, and physical envi-ronment upon pitching. Following the lag phase, yeast grows exponentially, rapidly depleting the available oxygen and key nutrients before entering an anaerobic environment. The fermentable wort sugars and assimilable nutrients are rapidly utilized, resulting in carbon and nutrient limitation, typi-cally prompting the cell to enter a quiescent state (see Chapter 1). These carbon- and nutrient-lim-ited conditions coincide with an increase in ethanol concentration (Casey et al., 1984). On completion of fermentation, yeast that has sedimented to the cone at the bottom of the cylindroconical vessel is removed (cropped) from the base of the cone and a portion of this yeast is stored under beer at low temperature (3–4°C) until required for use in sub-sequent fermentations (Briggs et al., 2004). Before repitching, yeast can be washed with food-grade acids (pH) in order to remove bacterial contami-nants (Simpson and Hammond, 1989), though the deployment of this practice is not consistent with best-practice hygiene and yeast management, which should obviate the need for this step. Yeast repitched into a fermentation vessel is subjected to the same procedures and indeed stresses in a cyclic manner. Serial repitching, whereby yeast cropped at the end of the fermentation is re-used in subsequent fermentations, is a process unique to brewery fer-mentations and should only be conducted a finite number of times to prevent yeast quality deteriora-tion and the consequent fermentation performance compromise.
One of the key drivers for large-scale brewing is the requirement to improve the eficiency of wort fermentation, leading to a reduction in fermenta-tion time and/or an increase in yield. The latter requirement has been addressed by the use of high-gravity worts, produced via the addition of sugar adjuncts that result in higher ethanol concentra-tions towards the end of fermentations (Casey and Ingledew, 1983; Casey et al., 1984; Stewart et al., 1988; Stewart, 2001). Traditional and more recent innovative developments in practice are usually

adopted to improve product quality and/or process eficiency; however, the fermentation of wort by yeast and the handling of yeast between fermen-tations results in exposure to numerous stresses (Gibson et al., 2007).


The general stress response Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrates two major stress response pathways, the heat shock response (HSR), which is activated in a complex manner by sublethal heat stress (Chatterjee et al., 2000) and mediated by the so-called heat shock transcription factor (HSF) (Bienz and Pelham, 1986; Morimoto et al., 1996). Alternatively, the general (or global) stress response (GSR) is activated by a number of  environmental  stresses  including  oxidative, pH, heat, and osmotic stresses, as well as nitrogen starvation (Ruis and Schuller, 1995; Schmitt and McEntee, 1996; Martinez-Pastor et al., 1996). The GSR is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation that allows yeast to respond to adverse environmen-tal conditions in a non-specific manner, in order that cellular fecundity is retained whilst specific responses are activated (Ruis and Schuller, 1995; Martinez-Pastor et al., 1996). The GSR is typified by the up-regulation of approximately 200 genes and their corresponding proteins, which are involved in a diverse array of cellular functions (Gasch et al., 2000; Causton et al., 2001). The expression of these genes has been demonstrated to occur in a process dependent upon the pentameric cis-acting sequence CCCCT within the promoter region of the induced genes. This so-called stress responsive element (STRE) was first identified in reference to the stress-induced expression of the CTT1 gene encoding  cytosolic  catalase  T  (Marchler  et  al., 1993) and subsequently in control of expression of the DDR2 gene, which encodes a putative chap-erone protein (Kobayashi and McEntee, 1993). It has subsequently been demonstrated that the activation of the STRE element of inducible genes is dependent upon two zinc finger transcriptional activators (Msn2p and Msn4p) (Martinez-Pastor et al., 1996; Schmitt and McEntee, 1996; Treger et al., 1998), which are active during a wide array of stresses (Ruis and Schuller, 1995; Hohmann, 2002),  including  those  associated  with  yeast handling in the industrial brewery and during the diauxic shift (Boy-Marcotte et al., 1998). This mode

of activation explains why exposure to one type of stress often confers resistance to another, unrelated form of stress (Lindquist, 1986). The general stress response is a transient phenomenon and Msn2p is rapidly degraded following the stress response (Bose et al., 2005).


Oxidative stress
Whilst molecular oxygen (O2) is necessary for
the release of energy during respiration, derivative
forms of O2, termed reactive oxygen species (ROS)
are produced endogenously by cells under aerobic conditions.  These  ROS  include  the  superoxide
radical  (O2–·),  hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2),  and
the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which can damage cell components, contribute to cellular ageing, and ultimately lead to cell death (Beckman and Ames, 1998). Specific effects include lipid peroxidation (Girotti,  1998),  protein  inactivation  (Cabiscol et al., 2000), and nucleic acid damage (Salmon et al., 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2006), including damage to mitochondrial DNA, which can lead to the generation of respiratory-deficient ‘petite’ mutants (O’Rourke et al., 2002; Doudican et al., 2005; Gibson et al., 2006). Oxygen’s apparently contradic-tory roles within the cell, that is being essential for aerobic respiration and other metabolic processes, whilst being inherently toxic, have been referred to as the ‘oxygen paradox’ (Davies, 1995).

Oxygen in the brewery
Interestingly, no definitive work concerning the required levels of oxygen for both propagation and fermentation has been published. In general terms, during fermentation some archaic ‘rules of thumb’ are applied such that for every °P increase in wort gravity an additional 1ppm of oxygen is required, which for the purposes of this review will be known as the 1:1 theory. The work of Ashraf and Smart, (in preparation), questions this guideline and the premise that the levels of oxygen applied are not attuned to the requirement of yeast generally. In very large-scale fermentations, the point of appli-cation of oxygen or air is also not uniform, and in any case oxygen uptake is not a metric for most full-scale fermentations. This is surprising because oxygen plays an essential role in the brewing process despite its potential toxicity. A supply of oxygen is necessary during brewery propagation and early

fermentation to generate yeast biomass and ensure that yeast is in optimum physiological condition for effective fermentation (Hammond, 2000; Hulse, 2003).  Oxygen  is  required  for  lipid  synthesis, which is necessary to maintain plasma membrane integrity and function, and consequently for cell replication (Hammond, 2000; Briggs et al., 2004). Sterols  are  synthesized  using  carbon  devolving from glycolysis via acetyl-CoA. The first part of the synthesis is anaerobic, involving the conversion of acetyl Co-A to squalene; the conversion of squalene to 2,3-epoxysqualene, the precursor to the forma-tion of sterols, requires molecular oxygen. (Boulton and Quain, 2003). A lack of oxygen can lead to an increase in cellular acetyl coenzyme A which can, in turn, lead to increased levels of esters such as ethyl acetate that can affect beer flavour (Briggs et al., 2004). Conversely, overexposure of yeast to oxygen in the fermentation vessel can result in excessive yeast growth at the expense of ethanol production (Briggs et al., 2004). Optimum oxygen levels are therefore necessary for successful beer production.
After fermentation is complete, the yeast cells that have sedimented out of the wort are re-used in subsequent fermentations. Serial repitching, a pro-cedure unique to brewery fermentation, may have important implications for yeast physiological state and fermentation performance (Powell et al., 2003) (see Chapter 1).

Defending against oxygen using antioxidants
The importance of oxidative stress to the cell is illus-trated by the number and diversity of antioxidant molecules that are synthesized by Saccharomyces spp. (Dawes, 2004). These antioxidant defences include the non-enzymatic molecules l-ascorbic acid,  d-erythroascorbic  acid,  flavohaemoglobin, glutaredoxin, glutathione (GSH), metallothioneins, polyamines,   thioredoxin,   ubiquinol,   trehalose, ergosterol, and enzymatic defences such as catalase, cytochrome c peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione   peroxidase,   glutathione   reductase, thioredoxin peroxidase, and thioredoxin reductase, (Higgins et al., 2003; Kwon et al., 2003; Dawes, 2004; Safi et al., 2006). Antioxidants synthesized by brewing strains have been measured in both small-scale  and  industrial  propagations  (Martin et al., 2003) and fermentations (Clarkson et al., 1991).  However,  some  of  these  indicators  are

regulated by STRE elements and can indicate the occurrence of other stresses (Costa and Moradas-Ferreira, 2001). Interestingly, Swan et al. (2003) observed that cellular levels of thioredoxin (TRX), a small, ubiquitous antioxidant protein, remained unchanged throughout an industrial fermentation, although extracellular concentrations increased as fermentation proceeded. It was also observed in laboratory-scale fermentations that the increase in extracellular TRX concentration was greater with higher wort dissolved oxygen concentrations (Swan et al., 2003). Cellular GSH concentrations vary during the brewing process (Gibson et al., 2006), falling in the early stages of both propagation and fermentation  before  increasing  steadily  as  each of these stages progresses. These results indicate that GSH content of cells may be reduced during exponential growth, followed by an accumulation as cells respond to nutrient depletion and enter stationary phase (Gibson et al., 2006).
It has also been observed that the relative gene expression of several antioxidant-encoding genes is high at the beginning of pilot-scale fermentations (Higgins et al., 2003) and this is followed by a strong up-regulation of oxidative stress response genes in the later stages of a small-scale fermentation (James et al., 2003). One reason for this observation is that antioxidants have been implicated in the protection of cells exposed to reducing environments (Rand and Grant, 2006) and ethanol stress (Costa et al., 1993, 1997; Pereira et al., 2001), both of which may be encountered by cells in the later stages of an industrial brewery fermentation. Furthermore, a number of antioxidant-encoding genes, including CTT1, contain the STRE promoter sequence and are involved in the GSR. Another possibility is that the change in antioxidant activity is related to the nutritional status of the wort, with transcription of antioxidant-encoding genes being up-regulated when glucose and other fermentable carbon sources are exhausted (Costa and Moradas-Ferreira, 2001). The  responsiveness  of  brewing  yeast  strains
to changes in oxygen concentration is likely to be strain-dependent at least in timing (Clarkson et al., 1991) or magnitude (Martin et al., 2003; Gibson et al., 2006). Sensitivity to oxidative stress has also been associated with growth phase and medium composition, both of which influence antioxidant levels and hence the resistance of individual strains (Martin et al., 2003; Gibson et al., 2006).

Antioxidants are not the only defence Trehalose is an important stress protectant (Theve-lein, 1984; Van Laere, 1989; Wiemken, 1990), conferring stability to the plasma membrane and enzymes and additionally acting as a carbon source during starvation (Fales, 1951; Eaton, 1960; Ches-ter, 1963; Panek, 1963). The level of trehalose is thought to be related to stress tolerance and adapta-tion (Thevelein, 1984; Van Laere, 1989; Hottiger et al., 1987a,b; D’Amore et al., 1991; D’Hautcourt and Smart, 1999; Majara et al., 1996a,b; Conlin and Nelson, 2007). Trehalose is accumulated in response to heat shock (Hottiger et al., 1987a,b; Majara et al., 1996b; Iwashashi et al., 1995), expo-sure to toxic chemicals (Attfield, 1987), ethanol stress (Eleutherio et al., 1993; Mansure et al., 1994; Majara et al., 1996b), and osmotic stress (MacKen-zie et al., 1988; Majara et al., 1996a).
Trehalose has also been implicated in the protec-tion of yeast cells and cellular components against ROS (Benaroudj et al., 2001; Herdeiro et al., 2006). The genes involved in trehalose synthesis (TPS1, TPS2,  TSL1,  TPS3)  and  degradation  (NTH1, NTH2, ATH1) (François and Parrou, 2001) are regulated by STRE elements and are up-regulated in response to various stresses, including oxidative stress (Parrou et al., 1997; Pedreño et al., 2002). Strains lacking the transcriptional activators Msn2p and Msn4p are unable to accumulate trehalose in response to stress (Parrou et al., 1997). Trehalose is known to inhibit the activity of essential enzymes, including glutathione reductase, which is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and reducing oxidative damage within the cell (Sebollela et al., 2004). It is thought that this inhibition saves the cell duplicating protective actions against ROS.

How much oxygen should be deployed during fermentation?
Oxygen cannot be eliminated from the brewing process, at least if serial repitching processes are desired. However, the 1:1 theory lacks merit and indeed supporting data. Maemura et al. (1998) found that the performance of yeast during small-scale  wort  fermentation  was  unimpaired  when yeast  had  been  propagated  with  only  limited aeration (one hour at the beginning of propaga-tion) compared with yeast exposed to a continuous supply of air. Little difference was seen in terms of

cell density, carbohydrate reserves, or unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) level (Maemura et al., 1998).
The presence of O2 in wort at the beginning of
fermentation allows yeast cells to synthesize lipids, thereby revitalizing the sterol-deficient cell popula-tion and ensuring that fermentation can proceed eficiently (see Chapter 1). An alternative approach involves oxygenation of the stored yeast prior to
pitching, thereby reducing the O2  concentration
necessary in the fermentation wort (Boulton et al., 2000; Depraetere et al., 2003). In this case, UFA synthesis occurs prior to pitching and the pitched yeast, being sterol-replete, has a reduced require-ment for wort oxygenation. Trials have found that pre-oxygenated yeast in unoxygenated wort per-forms as well as normal yeast in oxygenated wort in terms of fermentation profile, ester synthesis, and alcohol production; the only apparent difference in this investigation was a reduced yeast growth in the unoxygenated wort (Boulton et al., 2000).
While yeast cells are still exposed to O2, exposure
is more readily controlled in the storage vessels than in larger, industrial-scale fermentation vessels
and the use of excess O2 can be avoided (Boulton
et al., 2000). The potential reduction in fermenta-tion rate caused by the reduced cell density may be overcome by adjusting the pitching rate (Boulton et al., 2000). The reduction in cell growth in that
investigation may have been due to excessive O2
consumption, which can result in depletion of tre-halose. Optimum aeration of yeast prior to pitching has been shown to increase cell growth in unoxy-genated wort (Fujiwara and Tamai, 2003).
It  has  also  been  suggested  that  the  cellular
requirement for O2 can be reduced by supplemen-
tation of stored yeast or wort with unsaturated fatty  acid  (UFA)  or  sterol  (David  and  Kirsop, 1972; Taylor et al., 1979; Moonjai et al., 2003). Moonjai et al. (2003) have, for example, proposed the use of linoleic acid supplements as an alterna-tive to wort oxygenation and demonstrated that pre-conditioning yeast in this fashion removed the requirement for wort oxygenation. Viability and fermentation performance of supplemented cells in non-aerated wort were similar to those of unsup-plemented cells in aerated wort (Moonjai et al., 2003). Consequently, such supplementations may have potential in industrial fermentations by obvi-ating the requirement for O2, thereby mitigating
34 |  Smart


the effect of oxidative stress to yeast cells. It should, however, be noted that the β-oxidation of fatty acids within yeast cell’s peroxisomes can generate ROS
such as H2O2. Koercamp et al. (2002) detected an
oxidative stress response in yeast cells in chemostat cultures when the carbon source within the growth medium was switched from glucose to the fatty acid oleate.
Potential oxidative stress during brewing may be reduced by delaying the introduction of oxygen to the fermentation vessel. It has been found that, at least in small-scale fermentations, the fermenta-tion performance of yeast was improved when oxygenation began 4 hours after pitching compared with oxygenation prior to pitching (Lodolo and Cantrell, 2005). Delayed oxygenation also resulted in a higher UFA and ergosterol synthesis, reduced levels  of  off-flavour  compounds,  and  reduced free radical activity. It was hypothesized that the improved fermentation performance was due to improved pro-mitochondrial development in yeast
cells not exposed to potentially toxic O2 at an early
stage in their lifecycle (Lodolo and Cantrell, 2005). Whether delayed oxygenation is practical during industrial scale (3000hl) fermentations has yet to be demonstrated.


Osmotic stress
The advent of high- and very-high-gravity brew-ing  as  a  means  of  managing  brewing  capacity constraints has been a focus in the sector since the early 1990s. Two key stresses are associated with its deployment: osmotic and ethanol stress. Osmotic stress can be defined as any situation where there is an imbalance of intracellular and extracellular osmolarities,  suficient  to  cause  a  deleterious change in physiology (Csonka and Hanson, 1991). In natural environments, yeasts are continuously subjected to changes in external osmolarity that can be extremely detrimental to cellular functioning (Hounsa et al., 1998; Beney et al., 2000; Tamás and Hohmann, 2003). Indeed, osmotic stress may occur when there is a low external osmotic potential, for example in deionized water, and this is character-ized by an influx of water into the cell, resulting in hypo-osmotic stress (Csonka and Hanson, 1991; Dihazi et al., 2001). Conversely, and this is certainly the focus in brewing fermentations, osmotic stress may also result from exposure to environments

comprising high solute concentrations, leading to hyperosmotic stress characterized by the loss of cel-lular water and subsequently turgor (Blomberg and Adler, 1992; Wood, 1999).

Hyperosmotic stress in the brewery During the brewing process, there are two major sources of osmotic stress. The first involves the practice of acid washing that is employed by some brewers to remove bacterial contaminants (Ham-mond et al., 2001) and/or fluidise yeast slurries so that dispersal is more eficient following inocula-tion into the fermentation vessel. Acid washing regimes involve the submersion of yeast slurries in food-grade acids to achieve a pH within the range 2.2–2.4, which imparts osmotic stress mainly due to the abundance of dissociated H+ ions. The second source of osmotic stress occurs during inocula-tion into wort, a complex and highly concentrated medium containing high concentrations of sugars (Erasmus et al., 2003). The use of high-gravity (or higher-solute) worts (Panchal and Stewart, 1980) has been suggested to increase external osmotic pressure, resulting in a deterioration of viability, growth, and fermentation performance (D’Amore, 1992). In support of this, Cahill et al. (2000) have demonstrated that an increase in gravity of the propagation medium results in decreased viabilities in subsequent high-gravity (17.5°P) fermentations. More recently, Dumont et al. (2003) suggested that hyperosmotic stress may reduce the loss of yeast viability incurred in response to ultra-rapid cooling rates during freezing as a consequence of the reduc-tion in intracellular water.

Osmotolerance and osmoadaption Osmoregulation  in  yeast  is  dependent  on  the capacity to sense external stimuli and the resultant changes in physiology, biochemistry, and other cel-lular functions to meet the modified needs of the cell in light of that environmental change. There are two forms of ‘response’ that any cell may apply following exposure to osmotic challenge: osmotol-erance and osmoadaption.
Osmotolerance is strain-dependent and refers to the capacity of a strain to withstand osmotic imbal-ances (Werner-Washburne et al., 1993; Hounsa et al., 1998; Gasch and Werner-Washburne, 2002). In this scenario, tolerance is derived from an innate ability  to  withstand  the  deleterious  effects  of

hyperosmotic pressure as a consequence of ‘supe-rior’ membrane structure, vacuolar functioning, residual trehalose levels, and many other intrinsic factors (Latterich and Watson, 1991; Sharma et al., 1996; Singer and Lindquist, 1998; Nass and Rao, 1999). Indeed, osmotolerance is promoted by the abundance  of  osmoprotectant  macromolecules that stabilize cellular membranes, enzymes, other proteins, and possibly nucleic acids, with little effect on the intracellular water potential (Hernández-Saavedra et al., 1995).
Osmoadaption typically involves the cessation of replication (Poolman and Glaasker 1998) in favour of survival mode. The process involves a highly refined sensing and response system that is acti-vated in either acute or chronic form. Nass and Rao (1999) defined the chronic response (or acquired osmotolerance) as a signal transduction-mediated pathway that alters the levels of specific proteins, whereas the acute response is a rapid response invoked in response to sudden shifts in high exter-nal osmolarity. Both involve the accumulation of one or more types of molecule, termed osmoticum (pl=osmotica), within the cell in order to increase intracellular osmotic potential, and thus prevent cellular water loss (Yancey et al., 1982; Wegmann, 1986;  Blomberg  and  Adler,  1992;  Hernández-Saavedra et al., 1995). One subclass of osmotica, the compatible solutes, have very little effect on normal cellular functioning when accumulated at high levels (Poolman and Glaasker 1998) but the accumulation of this solute causes the cell to retain water that would otherwise be efluxed. Their role in stabilizing the cell during hyperosmotic stress is therefore crucial.
Glycerol is the key compatible solute accumu-lated during osmotic stress (Brown, 1978; Brown et  al.,  1986,  Blomberg  and  Adler,  1989,  1992, Albertyn et al., 1994; Hohmann, 1997), and dele-tions in key genes encoding enzymes in the glycerol biosynthetic pathway lead to an inability to survive hyperosmotic conditions (Albertyn et al., 1994; Eriksson et al., 1995; Liden et al., 1996; Ansell et al., 1997; Hounsa et al., 1998). Glycerol has an important secondary role to play in anaerobic stress, as the requirement of NAD+ in its produc-tion enables glycerol to serve as the final product in a ‘redox dump’ pathway (Ansell et al., 1997) and this is also relevant to brewing yeast fermentations. Cells subjected to high external osmolarity are able

to effectively sense this external stimulus using two surface sensor proteins, Sln1p and Sho1p (Maeda et al., 1994, 1995), which results in the activation of the HOG (MAP kinase) pathway. The HOG stimulates the hyperproduction and hyperaccumu-lation of glycerol as a compatible solute in order to balance the external and internal osmolarities (Albertyn et al., 1994; Remize et al., 2001; Pahl-man et al., 2001). It also appears to mediate the activity of the glyceroaquaporin Fps1p (Luyten et al., 1994; Tamás et al., 1999), which reduces the net eflux of glycerol and thus aids intracellular accumulation.
Saccharomyces  spp.  and  other  yeasts  show  a change in cell size concurrent with external osmo-larity changes (Hohmann, 1997). An increase in external osmolarity results in a rapid loss of intra-cellular water and thus cell shrinkage (Morris et al., 1986; Blomberg and Adler, 1992; Hohmann, 1997). Restoration of favourable (isotonic) solute conditions to hyperosmotically stressed cells does not, however, result in cells regaining their former volume (Hohmann, 1997).


pH downshift
Publications   concerning   fermentation   stresses frequently omit pH. This is unfortunate, since wort pH during a lager or ale fermentation is typically reduced  from  5.5  to  approximately  4.1  (Coote and Kirsop, 1976; Rowe et al., 1994). The practice of using acidified worts changes the extent of the downshift considerably. Any decrease in fermenta-tion pH occurs as a result of production of carbonic
acid (CO2), secretion of organic acids, and the con-
sumption of buffering compounds (basic amino acids and primary phosphates) in the wort (Coote and Kirsop, 1976). Coote and Kirsop (1976) found a similar buffering capacity in wort and beer and calculated that the removal of buffering materi-als and release of organic acids are insuficient to account for the magnitude of the pH drop typically observed  during  fermentation.  They  concluded that the secretion of H+ by yeast accounts for the discrepancy. The protons that are released poten-tially cause a decrease in the intracellular pH (pHi) (Ullah et al., 2012), thereby decreasing the activi-ties of metabolic functions. In addition, changes in pHi affect signal transduction (Dechant et al., 2010), protein interaction (Young et al., 2010), and

cell division rate (Orij et al., 2012). As a result of their charged state, the anions released also accu-mulate inside the cell where they may increase the internal turgor pressure and exert growth-inhib-itory interactions, depending on the nature of the anion (Ullah et al., 2012). The plasma membrane ATPase is, therefore, important in maintaining the intracellular pH, allowing the cell to adapt to acidic conditions. However, the energy demand for the activity of this enzyme may result in a depletion of the cell’s energy reserves in the form of ATP. Very little is known about the impact of lactic acid on brewing yeast during lambic beer fermentations or the production of Berliner Weiss beers; however, it can be hypothesized that during these fermenta-tions the pHi is significantly impacted.
The final pH of the fermentation is dependent upon the buffering capacity of the wort, initial wort pH, and the extent of yeast growth (Heggart et al., 1999; Narziss et al., 1983). Although it has been suggested that brewing yeasts readily tolerate the 1.5 to 2.0 unit down-shift in pH that occurs during fermentation (Boulton and Quain, 2001), recent evidence suggests that brewing lager yeast strains demonstrate some sensitivity to changes in this parameter, manifesting in modified specific growth rates and reduced replicative lifespans (Maskell, 2003).
pH can have a sizeable impact on the produc-tion of flavour components by yeast. A lowering of pitching wort pH from pH 5.75 to 5.46 can result in a reduction in dimethyl sulfide production of up to 50% (Anness and Bamforth, 1982). Furthermore, the rate of conversion of α-acetolactate to the detri-mental butterscotch flavour diacetyl was increased 4-fold when wort pH was lowered from pH 5.5 to 4.0 (Haukeli and Lie, 1978).
The downshift in pH during a typical lager fermentation also results in a change in gene expres-sion. In laboratory studies, S. cerevisiae experiencing a shift from pH 5.5 to 3.5 in minimal media dem-onstrated an increase in the expression of 36 genes (Kapteyn et al., 2001) involved in the cell wall, carbohydrate metabolism, redox metabolism, and stress.

Acid washing
Exposure to exceptionally low pH can occur if a brewery deploys acid washing. The use of acid washing is, in reality, a compensation for poor

hygiene and is not a practice most brewers would opt to use. It may eliminate bacteria, but wild yeast do survive and production strains can be negatively impacted despite retaining viability. Some brewer-ies have noted that the performance of their yeast strains was stimulated during fermentations after the application of acid washing (Brown, 1916; Russell and Stewart, 1995), some suggest that it may be diminished (Bruch et al., 1964; Roessler, 1968), and others (Simpson and Hammond, 1989; Cunningham and Stewart, 1998) suggest that there are no significant differences in the fermentation profiles. Despite this, there is little doubt that acid washing represents a stress to the cell. Trehalose has also been observed to accumulate (Cheng et al., 1999); proteins involved in plasma membrane integrity may be susceptible to denaturation, par-ticularly in the presence of ethanol (Jones, 1988; Simpson and Hammond, 1989); a reduction in viability, vitality, and flocculation may occur (Casey and Ingledew, 1983; Fernandez et al., 1993; Ogden, 1987; Simpson and Hammond, 1989); and newly formed daughter cells tend to exhibit poor survival rates (Maskell and Smart, unpublished data).
The   addition   of   diethylstilboestrol   during acid washing dramatically reduces yeast viability (Uchida  et  al.,  1988).  Diethylstilboestrol  is  an inhibitor of plasma membrane H+-ATPase and it has therefore been suggested that yeast death was most probably due to intracellular acidification as a consequence of the inability of the cell to release protons to maintain its intracellular pH. Evidence to support the hypothesis that plasma membrane H+-ATPase is essential for survival during acid washing  comes  from  the  studies  of  Eraso  and Gancedo (1987), who showed that plasma mem-brane H+-ATPase was stimulated by low pH (Eraso and  Gancedo,  1987).  However,  Carmelo  et  al. (1996) observed that S. cerevisiae cells grown in media with an initial pH of 2.5–6.0 exhibited H+-ATPase activities of 30% of the maximum value at pH 2.5, suggesting that overexposure to low pH has a negative effect. Growth impairment was also observed in these cell populations. There have been no reports on the effect of phosphoric acid on the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, but it is postulated that acid washing is a practice that can be highly damaging to plasma membrane functionality if not applied with due care.

Anaerobic shift and carbon dioxide toxicity
Brewing yeast experiences an anaerobic environ-
ment as a consequence of the accumulation of CO2
during fermentation. In addition, top pressures in storage tanks as a result of carbon dioxide or nitro-gen flushing result in a similar effect. Fermentation rate, the rate and extent of yeast growth, and the final concentration of fusel oils are all decreased
by increasing CO2 pressure, whilst the final pH is
decreased (Arcay-Ledezma and Slaughter, 1984; Jones and Greenfield, 1982; Kunkee and Ough, 1966). As a consequence, the final concentration of many flavour compounds and esters may be
decreased by increasing the CO2  pressure during
fermentation (Drost, 1977). Although its impact has not been extensively elucidated, anaerobiosis influences several cellular functions in yeast, includ-ing  modifications  in  cell  division  (Norton  and Krauss, 1972), cell volume (Lumsden et al., 1987), gene expression (Abramova et al., 2001a; James et al., 2003), metabolism (Hammond, 1993; Lewis and Young, 1995; Stewart et al., 1983; Zheng et al., 1994), amino acid uptake (Slaughter et al., 1987), and the cell wall (Abramova et al., 2001a; James et al., 2003; Lawrence et al., 2011).
Increases in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2)
results in decreases in the cell yield and growth rate of Saccharomyces yeast in beer fermentation (Knatchbull and Slaughter, 1987; Nakatani et al., 1984), although little change in fermentation activ-
ity due to pCO2 change were observed. Norton and
Krauss (1972) showed that cell growth stopped at
280kPa of CO2  pressure metabolically produced
during ethanol fermentation, but a culture pressur-
ized at 280kPa using N2 gas did not reduce the cell
growth rate (Norton and Krauss, 1972). Inhibition of budding and cell division by S. cerevisiae is there-
fore a result of increased CO2 concentration rather
than pressure. Although cell division ceases, dou-bling of the DNA content of the cells still occurs, indicating that the inhibition of cell division is not due to a lack of DNA replication (Norton and Krauss, 1972). Despite the increase in DNA con-tent of cells, the amount of RNA and protein per cell decreases (Lumsden et al., 1987). Lumsden et al. (1987) also found that that after 1 h at elevated
CO2 pressures, the mean cell volume of S. cerevisiae increased. This indicated that the influence of CO2
upon cell characteristics may be associated with a


change in cell size (Lumsden et al., 1987). Under
a CO2  pressure of 198kPa, fermentation of malt
extract medium by S. cerevisiae results in a changed pattern of absorption of amino acids in the first 4 hours, with a general excretion of amino acids thereafter (Slaughter et al., 1987).

Control of gene expression
Lai et al. (2005) examined the dynamic remodel-ling of the transcriptome during acclimatization to short-term anaerobiosis (two generations) under different metabolic states (catabolite-repressed or -derepressed). They determined that shifting cells from aerobic to anaerobic conditions in galactose medium induced an acute, yet transitory induc-tion  of  Msn2p-  and/or  Msn4p-regulated  genes associated with the retooling of reserve energy and catabolic pathways during the switch from respiro-fermentative to strictly fermentative growth. These changes are involved in balancing energetic supply and demand during this transition. Concomitantly,
genes associated with the G1/S transition phase
of the cell cycle were transiently down-regulated, resulting in a temporary arrest in the cell cycle. None of these networks were differentially expressed when cells experienced anaerobic shift in the presence of glucose, suggesting that a metabolically derived signal arising from the abrupt cessation of respira-
tion, rather than O2 deprivation, elicits this ‘stress
response’. In both media, under anaerobic condi-tions, more chronic, haem-dependant effects were observed, including the down-regulation of Hap1p-and  possibly  Hap2/3/4/5p-regulated  networks, derepression of Rox1p-regulated networks, and, following a slight delay, activation of Upc2p-regu-lated networks. These changes result in functional remodelling of sterol and sphingolipid metabolism, the cell wall, and dissimilatory pathways required for long-term anaerobiosis (Lai et al., 2005).
Ter Linde et al. (1999) and James et al. (2003) studied the transcription profiles of yeast during anaerobic incubation in chemostat culture and tall tube fermentations, respectively (ter Linde et al., 1999; James et al., 2003). During anaerobiosis, a number of genes, previously shown to respond to hypoxic conditions, were induced. These include ERG11, NCP1, AAC3, COX5, HEM13, OLE1, and the PAU gene family (Rachidi et al., 2000), which encodes the seripauperin proteins. Interestingly, 13  ORFs  of  unknown  function,  demonstrating
38 |  Smart


homology to the PAU genes, are also induced under these fermentation conditions. Members of the anaerobiosis-inducible  mannoprotein  DAN/TIR family are also highly induced under these condi-tions. Additionally, transcript levels for the hypoxic gene AAC3, which is transcribed optimally under anoxic or microaerophilic conditions, were also up-regulated.
Under   anaerobic   conditions,   cells   cannot synthesize  UFA  or  sterols  (Lorenz  and  Parks, 1991). An exogenous source of UFA and sterol is essential for long-term anaerobic growth in S. cerevisiae (Andreasen and Stier, 1953, 1954). Lai et al. (2005) showed that transcriptomic remodelling during anaerobiosis is fairly specific for sterol and sphingolipid pathways, with very few genes specific for phospholipid or fatty acid synthesis (save for OLE1 and AAC1) showing changes in expression. Genes in the early portion of the sterol synthesis pathway exhibit complex expression patterns, with some showing transient (ERG10) or chronic up-regulation (IDI1 and HMG2) and others showing transient (ERG8 and MVD1) or chronic down-regulation (ERG13, ERG20 and HMG1). Nearly all the genes in the downstream steps of the path-way were chronically up-regulated, as were genes involved in transport (PDR11 and AUS1) and their primary regulator (UPC2).

The cell wall responses to anaerobiosis
The yeast cell wall represents a dynamic organelle that  modifies  in  composition  and  functionality in response to external stimuli (Klis, 1994; Cabib et al., 1997; Caro et al., 1998; Abramova et al., 2001a; Boorsma et al., 2004; Rhymes and Smart, 2001; Smart, 2003; Lesage and Bussey, 2006). Under  aerobic  growth  conditions,  Cwp1p  and Cwp2p, encoded by the genes CWP1 and CWP2, respectively, are the most abundant cell wall man-noproteins and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis during cell replication (van der Vaart et al., 1995). During environmental stress, the composition of the cell changes, resulting in the increase in cell wall mannoproteins other than Cwp1p and Cwp2p (Abramova  et  al.,  2001a).  The  most  extensive response is the induction of several homologous mannoproteins (Dan1p, Tip1p, Tir1p, and Tir2p) during anaerobic growth. The genes encoding these proteins are referred to as the DAN/TIR genes. This

group of genes also includes genes for five other mannoproteins, designated Dan2p, Dan3p, Dan4p, Tir3p, and Tir4p. The Tir1p, Tir3p, and Tir4p proteins are required for anaerobic growth, with
knockout yeast becoming arrested at G1 in anaero-
bic conditions (Abramova et al., 2001a). During
N2-induced anaerobic adaptation, the CWP1 and
CWP2 genes are down-regulated and the DAN/ TIR genes are up-regulated, allowing an extensive remodelling of the yeast cell wall (Abramova et al., 2001a). The DAN genes DAN1 and DAN4 are
expressed within an hour of a N2-induced anaero-
bic shift, and DAN2 and DAN3 are expressed after approximately three hours (Abramova et al., 2001b). Anaerobic expression of the DAN/TIR genes depends on the binding of Upc2p to an upstream regulatory element. In addition, Ecm22p plays a role in the expression of DAN2 and DAN3 but not in the expression of any other DAN/TIR genes. Davies and Rine (2006) identified sterol level as the primary regulator of Upc2p. Further-more, they showed that DAN2 and DAN4 were activated by Upc2p solely in response to sterol depletion  rather  than  haem  depletion,  whereas DAN1 responded to both haem and sterols (Davies and Rine, 2006). Repression of the DAN genes results from the combined action of at least six repression factors – Mox1p, Mox2p, Rox1p, Rox7p, Tup1p, and Ssn6p (Abramova et al., 2001b). Some of the DAN genes are also repressed by Mot3p, a repressor that is induced by haem and repressed in anaerobic cells by Hap1p, in parallel with the Rox1p repressor. Abramova et al. (2001a) concluded that Mot3p, which is known to function as an activator or repressor of different genes through the same binding site, is an important activator of CWP2, presumably through the three Mot3p sites in the promoter. Dan1p, along with the putative ABC transporter   (ATP-binding-cassette   transporter) Aus1p, plays an essential role in anaerobic sterol uptake (Alimardani et al., 2004). No functions associated with anaerobiosis have been assigned to the products of DAN2, DAN3 or DAN4, despite their responsiveness to this condition.
The remodelling of the cell wall is important in the brewing context, as it has been demonstrated that the flocculation potential of brewing yeast strains is altered by growth in aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Lawrence et al., 2011; Lawrence and Smart, 2011).
Yeast Stress and Brewing Fermentations |  39


Ethanol toxicity
The primary purpose of brewery fermentation is the synthesis of alcohol from fermentable sugars and  the  production  of  particular  flavour-active compounds by Saccharomyces yeast. Under normal fermentation  conditions,  final  ethanol  concen-trations fall in the range of 3–6%, though under high-gravity fermentation this concentration may be greater than 10% (Briggs et al., 2004). The effects of ethanol toxicity on yeast physiology are diverse, though cellular membranes appear to be the main sites of ethanol damage. Specific effects include growth inhibition, reduced cell size (Canetta et al., 2006), reduced viability particularly for respiratory-deficient mutants of brewing strains (Gibson et al., 2009; Cheung et al., 2012), reduced respiration and glucose uptake (Pascual et al., 1988), reduced fermentation  (Fernandes  et  al.,  1997),  enzyme inactivation,  lipid  modification,  loss  of  proton motive force across the plasma membrane (Petrov and Okorokov, 1990; Mizoguchi and Hara, 1997), increased membrane permeability (Marza et al., 2002), lowering of cytoplasmic pH, and the induc-tion of respiratory-deficient mutants (Jiménez et al. 1988; Ibeas and Jiménez, 1997; Chi and Arneborg, 1999).
Beers produced through high-gravity fermenta-tion have also been found to have a greater flavour stability and consistency than those produced using normal gravity brewing (McCaig et al., 1992). This improved fermentation eficiency may, however, be at the expense of yeast physiological state and hence performance in subsequent fermentations.

Responses to ethanol
Yeast responding to increased ethanol concentra-tion demonstrates an increased unsaturation index, and fluidity, of their membranes (Beaven et al., 1982; Šajbidor and Grego, 1992; Lloyd et al., 1993; Odumeru et al., 1993; Alexandre et al., 1994a). This relationship is not absolute, and oleic acid (18:1) appears to be a key determinant of ethanol tolerance in S. cerevisiae, rather than unsaturation index, per se (You et al., 2003). S. cerevisiae cells also exhibit an increase in plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity in response to ethanol exposure (Rosa and Sá-Cor-reia, 1991, 1996; Alexandre et al., 1994b; Monteiro and Sá-Correia, 1997), counteracting the increased influx of protons across the plasma membrane of ethanol-exposed cells (Leão and Van Uden, 1984).

Fujita et al. (2006), found that homozygous diploid mutant strains of S. cerevisiae lacking genes involved in vacuolar H+-ATPase function were sensitive to ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-pentanol (Fujita et al. 2006).

Mitigating for ethanol
Typically in brewing, strains are selected for high-gravity brewing on the basis of their capacity to ferment according to profile and tolerate higher ethanol concentrations. Dilution of yeast slurries post cropping is a standard protocol used to ensure that cells are not exposed during storage to higher than necessary ethanol levels. However, there have been some studies suggesting other factors that might mitigate for the consequences of ethanol.
Increases in monounsaturated fatty acids, and corresponding decreases in saturated fatty acids have also been observed in ale and lager yeast strains exposed to ethanol, either directly through supplementation  or  during  fermentation  (Odu-meru et al., 1993). The membrane composition of brewing yeast is influenced by wort composition, and  supplementation  of  high-gravity  wort  with ergosterol and oleic acid (in the form of Tween 80) has been shown to significantly improve fermenta-tion rate (Casey and Ingledew, 1985) and ethanol productivity (Dragone et al., 2003). However, it is still unclear whether this improved fermenta-tion performance is due to an increase in ethanol tolerance because of changes to lipid membrane composition or simply due to improvement of the nutritional status of the growth medium, as sug-gested by Casey and Ingledew (1985).
Magnesium  ions  have  a  role  in  maintain-ing membrane integrity, and reduce the proton, anion, and nucleotide permeability of membranes exposed to ethanol (Salgueiro et al., 1988; Petrov and Okorokov, 1990; Hu et al., 2003). Increasing the bioavailability of Mg prior to or during ethanol shock reduces the synthesis of the heat shock pro-teins (Birch and Walker, 2000) and increases the viability (Walker, 1998; Birch and Walker, 2000; Hu et al., 2003) and growth (Ciesarová et al., 1996) of cells. In addition, supplementation of fermenta-tion media with magnesium has been shown to increase fermentation rate and ethanol productivity (Dombek and Ingram, 1986; Stewart et al., 1988; D’Amore et al., 1990; D’Amore, 1992; Ciesarová et al., 1996; Walker and Maynard, 1997; Rees and
40 |  Smart


Stewart, 1999). Impaired fermentation rates in the absence of suficient concentrations of Mg2+ may also be related to its role in regulating the activity of glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate kinase (Morris et al., 1984).
Exposure  of  cells  to  ethanol  stress  (16%) induces the synthesis of trehalose (Sharma, 1997) and increased accumulation of trehalose has also been observed in ale and lager brewing yeast strains exposed to 10% ethanol (Odumeru et al., 1993). Alexandre et al. (2001) demonstrated that genes involved in trehalose synthesis in yeast are up-regulated in response to ethanol stress.

Ethanol can permanently damage the cell
Ethanol is one of the most potent inducers of the petite phenotype in yeast (Jiménez et al., 1988; Ibeas and Jiménez, 1997; Chi and Arneborg, 1999; Castrejón et al., 2002) and it is therefore likely that the generation of petites during brewery handling is  strongly  influenced  by  repeated  exposure  to high ethanol concentrations during fermentation. Despite the association of ethanol toxicity with petite frequency, the actual mechanism of damage is unclear. Ethanol is not a powerful mutagen of yeast mitochondrial DNA, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (Ristow et al., 1995). It has been suggested that induction of petites may be related to the effects of ethanol on the mitochondrial mem-brane rather than on the mitochondrial DNA itself (Ibeas and Jiménez, 1997). It has been shown that lipid composition influences both ethanol sensitiv-ity and susceptibility to petite mutation (Chi and Arneborg, 1999). An ethanol-tolerant yeast strain with a low level of ethanol-induced mitochondrial petite mutation was found to have a relatively high ergosterol/phospholipid   ratio,   high   phosphati-dylcholine content, and high long-chain fatty acid component compared with an ethanol-sensitive strain  (Chi  and  Arneborg,  1999),  though  how these membrane characteristics affect mitochon-drial integrity in the presence of ethanol has yet to be elucidated. It may be that long-chain fatty acids have a role in counteracting the fluidizing effect of ethanol on membranes. The important role of the mitochondrial  membrane  in  maintaining  mito-chondrial DNA integrity has been demonstrated by the fact that strains with reduced ergosterol-synthesizing ability are more susceptible to petite

mutation (Jiménez et al., 1988). It has also been suggested that acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, may have a direct mutagenic effect on mitochondrial DNA (Ristow et al., 1995).


Cold shock

Low-temperature environments in the brewery
In S. cerevisiae (ale and wheat strains), cold shock occurs at temperatures below 20°C (Kondo and Inouye, 1991; Kondo et al., 1992; Kowalski et al., 1995; Abramova et al., 2001b). It is therefore no surprise that ale fermentations are typically conducted at higher temperatures, between 18°C and  25°C.  In  contrast,  lager  fermentations  are conducted at much lower temperatures and indeed lager strains are better able to grow at 10°C relative to ale strain counterparts. Interestingly, the cold tol-erance of lager strains is hybrid group specific. The Saaz strains display greater cold tolerance than the Frohberg strains (Gibson et al., 2013). Of the two yeast hybrids used for lager brewing, the Frohberg group has predominantly retained DNA of the S. cerevisiae parent, while the Saaz group has retained proportionally  more  of  the  S.  eubayanus  DNA (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008). These genetic differ-ences appear to reflect functional differences, with the Saaz strain apparently inheriting a relatively greater cold tolerance from the characteristically cryotolerant S. eubayanus parent.
Temperatures used for yeast storage between successive fermentations typically range from 2°C to 11°C and, where applied, acid washing is also conducted at 4°C. Yeast handling, therefore, con-sists of a series of low-temperature environments, which may lead to the yeast slurry experiencing cold shock, a phenomenon that is well documented in other organisms (Phadtare et al., 1998; Rodriguez-Vargas et al., 2002), but has not been extensively studied in yeast.

Cold tolerance and brewing
The exact mechanisms controlling cold tolerance in the lager yeast are still unknown. The uptake of the α-glucosides maltose and maltotriose is known to be sensitive to temperature (Vidgren et al., 2010) but different cryotolerances of the yeast groups are not necessarily related to differences in the sensitivity
Yeast Stress and Brewing Fermentations |  41


of  maltose  transporters.  Differential  maltotriose utilization may explain why Frohberg strains have historically been considered more industrially sig-nificant. The lack of active maltotriose transport in Saaz strains suggests that the transporters responsi-ble for uptake are absent or non-functional.

Cold tolerance and membrane fluidity
The  principal  fatty  acyl  chains  in  the  plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae are oleic acid (18:1) and palmitoleic acid (16:1), with trace amounts of palmitic acid and stearic acid also present. Mem-brane fluidity is largely determined by the packing of these molecules. Lowering of the temperature leads to a more ordered membrane structure and hence a reduction in fluidity (Shinitsky, 1984). The membrane is essentially modified from a liquid crystalline form to a gel state (Thieringer et al., 1998). This transformation alters various functions of membrane-bound proteins, such as the import and export of metabolites and proteins across the plasma  membrane.  The  mechanisms  by  which microorganisms  tolerate  changes  in  membrane fluidity has been well characterized and is termed ‘homeoviscous   adaptation’   (Sinensky,   1974). Depending  on  the  microorganism,  this  process involves  increasing  proportions  of  unsaturated fatty acids and/or cis double bonds into lipids, chain shortening, and methyl branching (Shaw and Ingraham, 1967; Sinensky, 1974; Shinitsky, 1984; McElhaney, 1982; Russell, 1989). Another physi-ological effect of lowering the temperature is the reduction in the hydrophobic interactions between the carbon skeleton of the polypeptide and the side chains of amino acids, exposing non-polar regions to water and risking protein denaturation (Gounot and Russell, 1999).

Impact of low temperature on genome-wide expression
In response to an abrupt drop in temperature, a change in gene expression has been postulated to allow for adaptation to the low-temperature envi-ronment (Sahara et al., 2002; Schade et al., 2004). This response is gene and time specific and involves the differential regulation of certain genes (Zhang et al., 2001, 2003; Sahara et al., 2002; Schade et al., 2004), presumably as a result of the altered physiological state of the cell caused by reduced

membrane transport, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and reduced enzyme activity (Sahara et al., 2002; Schade et al., 2004). The early phase of the cold shock response involves adjustments to membrane fluidity and prevents destabilization of RNA secondary structures to allow eficient protein translation. The late phase involves the up-regula-tion of genes involved in the general stress response, including those encoding heat shock proteins and metabolic enzymes engaged in glycogen and tre-halose metabolism (Sahara et al., 2002; Schade et al., 2004). Sahara et al. (2002) demonstrated that the genes involved in the general stress response are up-regulated following 4 hours of low-temperature exposure, whilst Schade et al. (2004) showed that they are still being up-regulated following 12 and/ or  60  hours  of  low-temperature  exposure.  The gene expression profile during growth at low tem-peratures (Homma et al., 2003) has been reported but this is to be differentiated from cold shock gene expression profiles since the former does not involve a sudden downshift in temperature.

Responding to cold
Several genes involved in yeast cold shock have been identified. These include the NRS1 gene (Lee et al., 1991; Kondo and Inouye, 1992; Kondo et al., 1992), the LOT genes (Zhang et al., 2001), and the cell wall-related TIR genes (Kowalski et al., 1995; Abramova et al., 2001a). Translation eficiency is greatly reduced at low temperatures due to the for-mation of secondary structures in RNA molecules and  the  inactivation  of  ribosomes  (Jones  and Inouye, 1996). To combat this, an early response to cold involves an increased expression of the major-ity of the genes involved in rRNA synthesis and processing (Sahara et al., 2002; Schade et al., 2004). Mga2p, a cold sensor, (Nakagawa et al., 2002) has been demonstrated to activate OLE1 transcrip-tion in response to low temperature (Nakagawa et al., 2002), which encodes an intrinsic membrane enzyme important for maintaining optimum levels of membrane fluidity and curvature. Interestingly, a large increase in OLE1 expression has been demon-strated during fermentation (Higgins et al., 2003; James et al., 2003), particularly during the initial stages (Higgins et al., 2003). Brewery fermentation is considered to be a low-temperature environment (Leclaire et al., 2003) where cold-induced Mga2p activation of OLE1 expression is likely to occur.

Further evidence that the membranes are a focus for cold shock responses comes from the observation that trehalose accumulation occurs at temperatures of 10°C and below, and coincides with induction of the trehalose-synthesizing enzymes Tps1p and Tps2p (Kandror et al., 2004). This is believed to be an adaptive response, which increases tolerance to low temperatures as well as freezing.
A remodelling of the cell wall appears to take place when cells are subjected to cold shock, since a  mannoprotein,  Cwp1p  (cell  wall  protein),  is down-regulated and expression of the TIP1, TIR1, TIR2 and TIR4 genes is induced (Abramova et al., 2001a). Since flocculation of lager yeast is increased at lower temperatures (González et al., 1996) and the temperature of growth has also been reported to affect the final flocculation capacity (Van Iersel et al., 1998), the TIR genes may be important for this fermentation characteristic.


Conclusions and future perspectives
The literature concerning yeast stress responses is largely focused on studies utilizing haploid labora-tory strains of S. cerevisiae. In this chapter, only those findings with relevance to key brewing performance indicators have been discussed. These studies are thorough and provide much evidence concerning the cell biology of stresses incurred during brewing. However, as a cautionary note they may not provide the full picture for lager strains, which are hybrids and do not belong to the same species, and ale and wheat strains, which are much more diverse from an evolutionary perspective than their counterpart lager strains and laboratory strains.
Most laboratory strains originate from ancestors prospected from the environment. These strains in turn were maintained in diploid and haploid forms and crossed in laboratories as scientists attempted to  understand  replication  (sexual  and  asexual) and genetics. As an example, the strain S288C was isolated as a result of multiple genetic crosses from strains originally derived from lager brewing yeast foam, baking and strains acquired for other laboratories. Several crosses were conducted with the  purpose  of  isolating  subsequent  biochemi-cal mutants. S288C was isolated because it was non-flocculent, could be grown readily and had a requirement for biotin allowing genetic studies

involving selective media to be utilized (Mortimer and Johnstone, 1986). This strain was then shared with the scientific community leading to further crosses, the descendants of which became labora-tory strains in their own right.
Lager yeast (S. pastorianus) is defined as an allopolyploid hybrid species of S. cerevisiae and a non-cerevisiae species. Originally this latter parent was assumed to be S. bayanus; however, the S. bayanus strain was itself shown to be a hybrid of S. cerevisiae and a non-cerevisiae species now known as S. eubayanus. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 and S. carlsbergensis CBS-1513 exhibit a markedly distinct genetic distance to S. cerevisiae S288c, despite the lager part-ancestry of S288C (Chen et al., 2016). This genetic distance confirms that observations made with laboratory strains may not reflect the responses of a lager strain.
Responses observed with one lager strain may not be indicative for lager strains in general. The reason for this is that lager yeast can be divided into two groups, Group I (Saaz/Carlsberg type) and Group II (Frohberg type). This division is based on the geographic heritage of the strains and has been supported by fermentation characteristics and molecular analyses (Gibson et al., 2013). S. carlsber-gensis CBS-1513 and S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 are considered typical for strains belonging to Groups I and II, respectively. The main difference between the two groups at the genome level is the chromosome ploidy. The lack of one group of S. cerevisiae chromosomes in Group I strains makes the Group I strains allotriploid and distinguishes the Group I strains from the allotetraploid Group II strains such as S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 (Chen et al., 2016). Thus, the portion of chromosomes  originating  from  S.  cerevisiae  in Group I strains is ≈33.3%, while this ratio in Group II strains is around 50.0%. In many brewing pub-lications  strain  dependent  phenomenon  have been  proposed  for  findings  not  conforming  to the expected phenotype. It would be interesting to reconsider these findings in light of the current understanding of relatedness and unrelatedness of some key industrial strains.
In addition to these important genetic differ-ences, the translation from brewing fermentations conducted at the laboratory or pilot scale to those occurring at full industrial scale is also problematic.


Primarily this is due to the failure of most laboratory systems to effectively mimic full scale operations. This is a gap that requires closure to fully evaluate the potential of brewing yeast. Despite these issues, the last 15 years has seen much progress in the field of brewing yeast stress research and with every pub-lication understanding improves.

Abstract
The bottom line in brewery fermentation is that consistency is paramount. Whatever the scale of the operation, excellent yeast quality is a funda-mental process requirement to ensure good and sustainable  beer  quality.  The  recycling  of  yeast across numerous fermentations adds complexity and biological stress. It is recommended that this be compensated by application of best practice in yeast supply/propagation, pitching, fermentation and storage. Craft brewers operating at a small scale and without recycling should be conscious of best practice for the rehydration of active dried yeast.


Introduction
With the exception of hybrid lager strains (Sac-charomyces pastorianus), domesticated yeast used in brewing, baking, distilling and most wine making is branded taxonomically as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This loosely translates to ‘sugar mould’ (saccharo-myces) and ‘beer’ (cerevisiae). Given its on-going contribution, yeast can justifiably claim to be one of humankind’s best friends. Indeed, in addition to its role in the fermentation of sugars, budding yeast has in recent decades become the pre-eminent model laboratory microorganism. This combined contribution to humankind has been neatly head-lined (Duina et al., 2014) as, ‘a kitchen companion for  centuries,  S.  cerevisiae  has  seen  exponential

growth (pun intended) as a laboratory companion over the past half century’.
A more recent turning point was the ground-breaking sequencing of the genome of S. cerevisiae S288C (Goffeau et al., 1996). Not surprisingly, since then S. cerevisiae has seen accelerated use as a model organism. So much so that Botstein and Fink (2011) noted ‘that yeast has graduated from a position as the premier model for eukaryotic cell biology to become the pioneer organism that has facilitated the establishment of the entirely new fields of study called ‘functional genomics’ and ‘systems biology.’ These new fields look beyond the functions of individual genes and proteins, focusing on how these interact and work together to deter-mine the properties of living cells and organisms.’
Stunning   contemporary   examples   of   yeast as a ‘pioneer organism’ include the creation of a synthetic  chromosome  III  (foreshadowing  the possibility of entirely synthetic yeast genomes) (Pennisi,  2014),  the  successful  replacement  of defective yeast genes with their human counter-parts (Kachoo et al., 2015) and diverse ‘engineered’ yeasts on the road to producing – amongst other things – penicillin, opiates and anti-malarial drugs.
In the world of brewing yeast things have been a little less newsworthy. That said, the genome sequence of the widely used S. pastorianus Weihen-stephan 34/70 was published in 2009 (Nakao et al., 2009) and that of the first pure culture lager yeast
54 |  Quain


(Carlsberg Unterhefe No.1) in 2014 (Walther et al., 2014). Recently, there has been a flurry of excite-ment around the hybrid genome of lager yeast, S. pastorianus, comprising S. cerevisiae and another (cryotolerant) yeast. The identification of Saccha-romyces eubayanus from southern beech forests in Patagonia (Libkind et al., 2011) as the ‘other’ yeast caused something of a stir in the wider news media. In particular, the disconnect between lager brewing originating in Bavaria in the fifteenth century but predating trans-Atlantic trade triggered a hunt for a sources of S. eubayanus closer to Germany. Although the route is still by no means clear, it is suggested to ‘be the product of multiple long-distance dispersal events’ (Gayevskiy and Goddard, 2015), this yeast having been found in Tibet (Bing et al., 2014) and New Zealand (Gayevskiy and Goddard, 2015) (see Chapter 4).
Although a fascinating one-off, there is a wider ‘halo effect’ of stretching academic research that can be overlaid to aid the understanding of yeast during brewing fermentation and associated han-dling. This is fitting as globally brewing research is sadly in decline. There are a few hotspots but the halcyon days of the 1980s for applied brewing yeast research are no more. However much can be learned and applied from fundamental studies and related worlds such as biofuel and wine research.
This various process steps reviewed in this arti-cle are summarized in Fig. 3.1.




















Figure 3.1 Process overview.

Yeast supply
Although very much the norm in brewing, the recycling of yeast from one fermentation to another is unusual. The approach is used in biofuel produc-tion (Walker, 2011), but other fermentation-based processes typically adopt a ‘single trip’ approach with no ambition or opportunity to recover yeast and use it again. The supply of yeast into the fer-mentation process in breweries can be achieved in a variety of ways that are differentiated by scale and volume. It is rare but not unheard of, to use a yeast strain without replacement for years or decades but is typically capped at so many ‘generations’ (i.e. fermentation batches). There is no hard and fast rule as to the number of generations, though there is a trend down from 15–20 to 10 to five or fewer generations in recent years. The vast majority of brewers will – as policy – replace their brewing strains periodically with the supply and propaga-tion of pure cultures. The interpretation of this approach can take different shapes where the com-plexity of supply and level of quality assurance is at its greatest for large brewing companies and groups. This involves the cryopreservation and storage of propriety strains and their quality assured recovery and staged laboratory and plant propagation into fermenter. Whilst this undeniably the best possible practice to achieve strain purity and yeast quality, other approaches are none the less focused on qual-ity and hygiene. Depending on scale and size, some breweries contract with a supplier to store, assure, validate and provide liquid slurries of their strain. Beneath this and typically with the smaller volumes of new and growing craft breweries, a new market for the supply of yeast has grown. Here ‘type’ yeast strains are provided as liquid cultures or as active dried yeast for pitching directly into fermenter. At around 15hl or below it is economically viable to adopt a ‘pitch and ditch’ approach, whereby ‘ready to pitch’ cultures are used without recycling. Much above  these  volumes,  cropping  and  re-pitching becomes an increasingly likely process outcome.

Best practice
Irrespective of the number of generations a yeast strain is used, the underpinning process of ‘yeast supply’ must satisfy the fundamental requirements of strain integrity and purity. The implications of introducing the wrong strain or a contaminated ‘right’  strain  are  discussed  in  ‘consequences  of
Yeast Supply, Fermentation and Handling |  55


failure’ below. Accordingly, yeast supply is techni-cally demanding and outside the usual demands of brewery microbiological QA. In larger, typically global operations, the process is managed in-house or increasingly outsourced to a specialist third party. The importance of yeast supply often warrants its inclusion in quality management systems such as ISO 9001. Irrespective of provenance, best practice for the supply of pure yeast cultures is broadly the same, consisting of three key steps; preservation/ storage, recovery and supply. A full outline of a successful yeast supply process for the supply of production  brewing  yeasts  has  been  described (Quain, 1995). This reiterates the importance of the process and the unambiguous requirement to start out with the required yeast strain, a consid-eration that drives the comparative emphasis of the subject below.

Long-term storage – cryopreservation versus freeze-drying
It goes without saying that the method of long-term storage is fundamental to the success of yeast supply for propagation in the brewery. As noted previously (Quain, 1995), ‘the ideal method should be genuinely long-term in that yeast can be stored for many years without compromising viability or genetic stability’. It is generally accepted that the ‘gold standard’ for preservation of yeasts and other cells (e.g. blood, sperm, ova etc.) is storage in liquid nitrogen at its boiling point of −196°C. Cryopreservation is considered to be the most robust long-term approach, which maintains yeast viability without any genetic change.
There are a number of reports in the brewing literature of the use of liquid nitrogen to store production  yeast  strains  (reviewed  in  Boulton and Quain, 2001; Quain, 2006b). These publica-tions stem from a different time (1973–2003) and from  brewing  companies  that  have  now  been subsumed into today’s global brewers. Irrespective of this, the technology supporting cryopreserva-tion remains essentially unchanged. Suspensions of the yeast ‘master culture’ are stored in short, coloured polypropylene ‘straws’ in boxes or tubes immersed in liquid nitrogen. The hardware con-sists of cryovessels, which must be kept topped up from a storage tank of liquid nitrogen. The health and safety demands of using liquid nitrogen are

stringent, a point seemingly overlooked in its use in restaurants and bars!
Although long-term storage in liquid nitrogen requires little more than topping up the cryovessels, the biggest barrier to entry is the need for special-ist resources to carefully manage the introduction of yeast into store. For success, there must be strict adherence to detailed methods, which define the physiology of the yeast (oxidative), its concentra-tion (100×106 cells/ml) and suspension in fresh media   containing   a   cryoprotectant   (glycerol) followed  by  two-stage  phased  freezing  (room temperature  to  −30°C  and  then  immersion  at −196°C). Recovery is a little more straightforward via removal of the straw from liquid nitrogen and transfer to water at 30°C. Bond (2007b) provides a detailed methodology for the cryopreservation of yeast as used at the National Collection of Yeast Cultures in the UK.
An alternative and older method – freeze-drying or lyophilization – has had a mixed press regarding its impact on yeast viability. Like cryopreservation, freeze-drying also demands expertise and specialist equipment (Bond, 2007a). In a companion article, Bond (2007b) notes that for freeze-drying, ‘strain viabilities are generally low, typically between 1 and 30%, as compared with more than 30% for those of yeast preserved in liquid nitrogen’. There have been a number of reports with brewing strains over the decades (Kirsop, 1955, 1974; Hall and Webb, 1975; Russell and Stewart, 1981) that paint a similar picture of a significant loss in viability post drying and then little change during storage over many years. Mindful that methods develop and improve, a similar conclusion was reported by Miyamoto-Shinohara et al. (2000). Here the viability of S. cerevisiae (95 strains) was 6–10% post drying and 4–8% (43 strains) after 10 years of storage. It is noteworthy that in this study from the Patent Microorganism Depository in Japan, Gram-positive bacteria exhibited a survival rate of around 80% and Gram-negative bacteria around 50%. However, it is clear (Bond, 2007a) that there are opportunities to improve and tune the process through the use of lyoprotectants such as a mix of skimmed milk, trehalose and sodium glutamate.
Yeast culture collections range from ‘enormous and well-known’ to ‘smaller, more specialized bou-tique collections’ (Boundy-Mills, 2012). Some of the industry-specific collections have broadened
56 |  Quain


their focus to embrace other industries and to cap-ture new funding sources. Table 3.1 details some commercial sources of brewing yeasts together with other collections that contain a myriad of diverse yeasts, some of which may have been sourced from breweries.
Although rarely explicit, it is noteworthy that culture collections are ambivalent about the mode of preservation. It would appear that both freeze-drying and cryopreservation are used, with strains stored via both techniques or one or the other. A frank explanation for this is offered by the Agricul-tural Research Service in the USA, which maintains the biggest collection of yeasts (some 14,500) in the world. They note that ‘liquid nitrogen storage seems to cause little or no genetic change in cells. The reasons for not relying on this method exclu-sively for preservation of cultures are: cost and the fact that lyophilized preparations may be shipped by regular mail whereas strains preserved by liquid nitrogen must first be grown on agar or in liquid medium to avoid the expense of shipping frozen materials’. (http://nrrl.ncaur.usda.gov/TheCollec-tion/AccessionMaintenance.html#Maintenance)
A different and more targeted interpretation of yeast supply is the one that feeds into the vibrant world of craft brewing. Here ale, lager and ‘speci-ality’ brewing yeasts are marketed for direct use, either as liquid cultures or as ‘active dried’ yeasts (see below). Typically, small-scale operations use the yeast culture once without any subsequent han-dling or recovery. The ‘speciality’ segment describes a dazzling array of production strains for different beer styles. The less technically onerous approach of supplying liquid cultures is not surprisingly sup-portive of a greater number of yeast strains.

Recovery and supply
Whilst ‘best practice’ for yeast preservation and storage from culture collections is ambivalent, it would be argued that cryopreservation is the safer approach. Certainly, if production yeasts are depos-ited for subsequent supply back to the brewery by a third-party operation, cryopreservation would be strongly recommended as providing a more robust and assured route in maintaining strain integrity and viability. The above concerns regarding the pit-falls of freeze-drying raise real concerns about the viability of the master strain and threat from more robust variants.
Recovery of yeast from storage (in liquid nitro-gen) is clearly a ‘critical control point’ in the supply of yeast for propagation and then production fer-mentation. Accordingly, the ‘recovery’ step requires a  documented  programme  of  quality  assurance to confirm the identity of the yeast strain and its microbiological purity. Application of best practice is mandatory and depending on scale, key points are best performed with two people to eliminate any risk of mix-ups. Whilst the approach detailed in Quain (1995) to confirm strain identity and purity is exhaustive and extensive (Table 3.2), it can be easily justified, as any failure in the process of yeast supply will potentially have a far more dramatic impact on process and product quality. The same principles and group of tests are used to validate the master culture that is stored in liquid nitrogen.
The ‘supply’ of pure yeast of the required pro-duction strain can be either as an agar slope or – increasingly from a third party supplier – a liquid culture. Cutting corners here defeats the object so the entire liquid culture or slope is used to initiate the propagation process.

Consequences of failure
The consequences of a failure in the yeast supply process can be dramatic. Introduction of contami-nated yeast or – far, far worse – the wrong strain can slowly but surely cause accumulated havoc. Scale-up through propagation and subsequent pitching into one fermenter and then two fermenters and beyond can quickly exacerbate a problem. In terms of threat, contamination of the supplied yeast may or may not be an issue depending on the domi-nance of any contaminants. Bacterial contaminants should hopefully be flagged through routine qual-ity testing. However, from experience, the supply of the wrong yeast results in a much greater chal-lenge to detect. The unfortunate introduction – via a failing yeast supply process – of a phenolic yeast into a major lager brewery caused huge issues that were dificult to manage through blending with ‘good beer’. Less dramatic and harder to spot is substitution by similar yeast that behaves atypically in fermenter and triggers a shift in product flavour and aroma.


Propagation
To take a production strain from yeast supply to fer-menter requires a progressive scale-up in biomass. The process of pure single culture ‘propagation’ dates back to Emile Christian Hansen at Gamle Carlsberg brewery in 1883 whose yeast – having been originally sourced from the Spaten brewery in Germany in 1845 – comprised four strains some 38 years later. Hansen developed several techniques to isolate pure yeast strains and – in doing so – paved


the way for the philosophy of pure yeast cultures and their propagation.
The first propagator for Hansen’s pure brewery yeast  (Carlsberg  Unterhefe  No.1)  was  built  in 1885 in Copenhagen and was made of copper, con-tained 2.2hl of wort, a stirrer and pressurized with compressed sterile air (Annemüller et al., 2011). Subsequent developments in what are now stain-less steel brewery propagators have rightly focused on the assurance of hygiene, which remains the pre-eminent requirement of the process. As noted succinctly by White and Zainasheff (2010), ‘when propagating yeast, the sanitation and oxygen needs are much higher than when brewing’.
Whilst hygiene is a given, attitudes vary in the extent to which oxygen is made available to yeast during propagation. One school of thought is that propagation should be ‘aerobic’ with the intent of achieving a high cell count. The more traditional approach of 20–30 years ago was to add air inter-mittently (a few minutes per hour) throughout propagation and to accept a lower yeast cell count (ca 50×106/ml). Things here have changed such that turnkey, commercial propagators are ‘semi-aer-obic’ with more frequent and eficient aeration and accordingly higher cell counts of ca 80–100×106/ ml (Maca, 2015). Here, the ‘fermentation’ is often incomplete  as  actively  fermenting  yeast  (‘high krausen’) is considered to be better adapted for the first fermentation. Conversely with the aerobic approach, the wort is fully attenuated so as to gener-ate as much yeast as possible. Whichever approach is used, the end game is to ensure that suficient yeast is available from the propagation process to achieve the required inoculum for the first fermen-tation.
Propagator designs vary but frequently involve two vessels. These are often differently sized to minimize the extent of scale up, with the final tank being large enough to deliver the required cell count. The complexity of the design is driven by the attitude to oxygen. As yeast has a voracious appetite for oxygen, aerobic propagators require an agitator, sparge ring and bafles. Commercial semi-aerobic brewery  propagators  are  comparatively  simpler with an internal aeration lance/air injector, often together with a sinter or stone to aid gas transfer. Formation of foam can be significant and is man-aged passively by maintaining a large headspace (as

much as 100%), top pressure or temporary shut-down of mixing and gas flow (if ‘aerobic’), or on/ off cycles of aeration (semi-aerobic). Alternatively, foam formation can be reduced by replacing in situ aeration with periodic aeration in line via external recirculation of the vessel contents (Maca, 2015).
Although propagation is usually a batch process, the on-going reduction in fermentation ‘genera-tions’ has increased the pressure on propagation capacity. Realistically, installing a new plant is not always an option, as this requires significant capi-tal expenditure and space. ‘Drauflassen’ (Kunze, 2014) or ‘repeated fed-batch’ propagation (Thiele and Back, 2007) can provide a practical solution through cycles of partially pitching-on (80–90% by volume) and topping up the residual 10–20% with fresh wort. As ever, hygiene is paramount, which in such a process must be managed and monitored. Similarly, the threat of selecting for variants of the primary yeast should be considered and the risk assessed. The threat from either route is best man-aged by limiting the number of top-up cycles.
More recently, though, the philosophy of brew-ery propagation has moved significantly to being a forcibly aerobic process that achieves better yields of high viability yeast. The drivers and philosophy of  aerobic  propagation  have  been  outlined  at length (Boulton and Quain, 1999, 2001; Quain, 2006b). The basic premise was that ‘traditional’ propagators  had  a  ‘fermentation  mindset’  and were not geared to growing yeast. Consequently, first-generation fermentations were badly under-pitched   and   excruciatingly   slow   or   required complex  protracted  arrangements  of  part-filling and, some days later, topping up. Conversely, ‘aero-bic propagation’ sought to ensure oxygen was not limiting yeast growth and that the biomass yield/ cell count was suficient to pitch at the normal rate and achieve as near as possible standard cycle times. Further, the ‘rule’ of propagating ale yeast at ale fermentation temperatures and lager yeast at lager fermentation temperatures was parked and replaced with propagation of both lager and ale strains at a fixed temperature of 25°C.
Although  labelled  ‘aerobic’,  the  presence  of fermentable sugars (and the associated catabolite repression) results in yeast metabolism remaining fermentative. Accordingly, unlike fed-batch baker’s yeast propagation, conversion of sugar to biomass is relatively ineficient, at no more than 7.5%. The key

to maintaining detectable but low levels of oxygen throughout propagation is the rate of gas trans-fer achieved through mixing and increasing gas flow rate. Indeed as described previously (Quain, 2006b), for a 220hl second-stage propagator with a perforated sparge ring, heavy-duty agitator, and baf-fles, the maximum agitation speed was 58 rpm with an oxygen flow rate of between 10 and 100l/min. Dissolved oxygen need not be routinely monitored but is established during commissioning via a blend of agitation and variable gas flow rates. The ‘proof of the pudding’ is that aerobic propagation delivers a yeast of high viability (>95%) and cell count of ca 200×106 cells/ml, which is three or four times more than in the traditional brewery yeast propaga-tor. In passing, it is noteworthy that the achievement of such high cell counts requires the addition of zinc at 0.5mg/l (rather than 0.2mg/l) (Boulton and Mieleneiewski, unpublished observations; 2006).
In addition to the number of cells, aerobically propagated yeast benefit from being lipid ‘replete’. Oxygen is required for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and sterols, which play a key role in membrane function (see Chapter 1). The sterols are thought to act as a ‘mechanical reinforcer in membranes and also as an antioxidant that protects lipids during dehydration’ (Rozenfelde and Rapo-port, 2014). In the absence of oxygen and with new cell division, these non-polar lipids are mobilized as sterols and phospholipids to play their role in the membrane bilayers of the cell (Koch et al., 2014). Of course, in the wider context of brewery fermentation, the addition of oxygen to wort is to enable the fresh synthesis of sterols and UFA that are diluted by cell division and found in depleted levels in anaerobic yeast at the end of fermentation (see ‘Fermentation’).

Best practice
It  is  important  for  the  propagation  process  to deliver. After all, the output represents the begin-ning of a process where yeast will be cycled from fermentation vessel to storage tank and back any-where between 3 and 15 or more occasions. The success is built on the twin pillars of hygiene and stepwise scale-up in volume (and biomass). It is important that the ‘steps’ are appropriately sized. Cutting a step and stretching the size of the yeast inoculum can backfire if then a contaminant or vari-ant can ‘punch above its weight’ and compete with
Yeast Supply, Fermentation and Handling |  59


the primary yeast strain. The various steps in a typi-cal large-scale propagation process are detailed in Table 3.3. Whether the yeast is sourced on an agar slope or as a liquid culture, the laboratory and plant steps in yeast propagation are geared to produce suficient yeast of the correct strain and cleanliness to pitch into fermenter at the normal rate. Depend-ing on scale, provision of liquid culture is beneficial in precluding some (or all) of the laboratory steps.
Irrespective of the size of the first-generation fermenter, propagation should be semi-aerobic – or better still, fully aerobic – so as to maximize yeast count, viability, and levels (stored and free) of sterols and UFA. The propagator should be sized appropriately so that on pitching into the first gen-eration fermenter the yeast pitching rate meets the required specification.

Consequences of failure
Propagation of brewery yeast sets the tone of sub-sequent fermentations generation by generation. The ‘traditional’ propagation approach is without

focus on cell yield. The addition of oxygen to the propagator via the periodic bubbling of air via a ‘lance’ achieved little if any gas transfer so that propagation was effectively anaerobic. Yields were poor (ca 50×106/ml) and little attempt was made to match the required yeast pitching rate. At best the fermentation vessel would be partly filled and then topped up some days later with fresh wort. Typically, the performance of such yeast would be woeful, such that the fermentation charts tracking gravity fall would extend from the usual single page to two or even three pages. Such extended fermen-tations result in poor-quality yeast of compromised viability. On pitching on, this extends fermentation vessel cycle times, and at best a number of fermen-tation generations are required before the yeast achieves the required and repeatable cycle times and associated product quality.
The above is the readily visual ‘tip of the iceberg’. Cutting corners in terms of hygiene or step-up volumes can add further woe in terms of product

Yeast supply – active dried yeast
Active dried baker’s yeast was developed during the  Second  World  War  to  avoid  the  need  for refrigeration during its transport and storage. Not surprisingly, the technology has been developed and in recent years extended to include yeasts for brewing,  distilling,  wine  making  and  biofuels. These days active dried yeast (ADY) is produced via fed-batch fermentations with beet and cane molasses as the feedstock. A review of the process can be found in Ingledew et al. (2009).
Unlike aerobic brewery propagation of yeast, the aerobic fed-batch approach is unequivocally focused on the eficient production of yeast bio-mass such that conversion of sugar to biomass is in the region of 54% (opposed to ca 5% from anaerobic  fermentation)  and  with  no  ethanol formation. Accordingly, the downside is that yeast from this process is physiologically very different (oxidative) from the ‘fermentative’ yeast produced via aerobic propagation or from brewery fermenta-tion. However, yeast produced in this way is much better equipped for the extreme rigors of drying to approximately 8% moisture via fluidized-bed or airlift dryers. The fed-batch process would be antici-pated to result in yeast forming more sterol (4% of the yeast dry weight) than is formed through aero-bic propagation (1%) (Quain and Haslam, 1979). Further, as the amount of sterol determines how many rounds of cell division can occur during fer-mentation, ADY will potentially divide more times. This is helpful should the fermentation be under-pitched but, conversely, at normal pitching rates will lead to greater yeast growth than the norm. Either way, with ADY there is no metabolic requirement to aerate or oxygenate the wort as the yeast comes pre-loaded with sterols and unsaturated fatty acids.
In a brewing context, the ‘convenience’ in terms of long-term, simple storage of ADY is especially beneficial as, in one fell swoop, it removes the need for yeast supply, propagation, cropping, and stor-age of yeast. Such a single trip or ‘pitch and ditch’ approach was pushed enthusiastically in the late 1990s as a viable option for ‘small scale craft brew-ers, franchise brewing operations, or in situations where particular beer qualities may be produced

infrequently’ (Boulton and Quain, 2001). Jump forward to 2015 and ADY has played its part in the dramatic growth of craft brewers around the world with some 1700 breweries in the UK (British Beer and Pub Association, 2015) and ca 4200 in the USA (www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/ number-of-breweries/).
ADY is used by craft brewers big and small. At the smaller end of the scale, the pitch and ditch approach is very much the norm. Pitching rate is not controlled directly but is based more on mar-rying the supplied pack size with fermenter volume. However, as output grows this approach becomes increasingly cost-prohibitive and accordingly pro-cesses for yeast cropping, storage, and repitching must be introduced.
Concerns over contamination of ADY and its viability have lessened in recent years. As noted by Ingledew et al. (2009), ‘yeasts grown aerobically in a yeast factory … will inevitably contain low levels of bacteria and wild yeasts that grow under the same fermentation conditions’. However, hygienic practices have tightened such that the specification for bacteria and wild yeast is a respectable <1 cell per 106  viable yeast cells or less. Similarly, there is less focus on viability with suppliers majoring on declarations such as ‘viable cells at packaging: >6×109/g’ or ‘living yeast cells at ≥7×109  per gram of dry yeast’.
Under the banner of convenience, ADY offers the benefit of protracted storage of up to 2 years, which lends itself to infrequent or seasonal use. However, there are caveats such as storage tempera-ture (4°C for one supplier or <8°C for another) and, upon opening, use within 3 or 7 days. There is some ambiguity on stability with one view that ‘activity loss is about 25% per year at 8°C or 50% per year at 22°C’ (www.danstaryeast.com/prod-ucts). A somewhat more coy approach is that ADY can be ‘stored at room temperature for periods of time not exceeding 3 months without affecting its  performance’  (www.fermentis.com/brewing/ industrial-brewing/product-range/).
Although yeast ‘stress’ is a big-ticket item in brewing (Gibson et al., 2007), it is doubtful if any stresses encountered during brewing compare with that of drying and rehydration. There is alarm-ing talk of drying causing protein misfolding and aggregation together with effects on the integrity and functionality of intracellular membranes. On
Yeast Supply, Fermentation and Handling |  61


drying  and  hydration,  these  ‘leaky’  membranes allow the loss of low molecular weight compounds (e.g. ions, nucleotides). Going the other way, there is a mandatory need for careful rehydration of ADY. Rehydration of the cell must be performed sympa-thetically to enable the reconstitution of functional membranes and metabolic homeostasis such that the population is broadly viable for fermentation and cell division to occur.
In preparation for drying, manufacturers use proprietary ‘tricks of the trade’ to enhance the readiness of yeast for drying. As noted above, the disaccharide trehalose is one of a number of com-pounds that can be added exogenously to improve the freeze-drying of yeast strains. It – together with the polysaccharide glycogen – are classed as storage or reserve carbohydrates in yeast that accumulate when nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, sulfur, or phospho-rus) or energy become limiting (Lillie and Pringle, 1980). More generically, trehalose is present ‘in particularly high concentrations in resting or in stressed cells’ (Feldmann, 2012). Accumulation of trehalose is reported as ‘adding value’ to industrial applications such as baker’s yeast production and high-temperature   bioethanol   fermentations   in Brazil (Eleutherio et al., 2014). Somewhat multi-talented, trehalose is flagged as conferring general resistance to heat and desiccation. More specifi-cally, trehalose stabilizes and prevents damage to membranes (and proteins) during desiccation by substituting  for  water  through  hydrogen  bond-ing. Importantly, to be most effective, trehalose is required on both the inner and outer sides of the membrane (reviewed in Eleutherio et al., 2014). However, after more than 40 years of research the role of trehalose as a generic stress protectant has been questioned. Taking advantage of the same disaccharide transporter to enhance intracellular trehalose, there is direct evidence that trehalose confers desiccation tolerance (Tapia et al., 2015) or that correlation with stress is ‘purely coincidental’ and is down to a ‘moonlighting’ protein, a cata-lytically inactive variant of trehalose-6P synthase (Petitjean et al., 2015).
Rehydration of active dried yeast is very much in the hands of the user. Manufacturers of dried brewing yeasts are prescriptive as to rehydration but differ in the detail. For example, (i) the yeast is sprinkled on 10 times its weight of sterile water at (ii) 27±3°C or 30–35°C after which (iii) stand

for 15 or 15–30 minutes and (iv) gently stir for 30 minutes or stir to suspend and stand for 5 minutes at 30–35°C. The yeast is then pitched directly or after cooling to the temperature of the wort. There is a difference of opinion on rehydration of yeast directly into wort, with one manufacturer encour-aging it and the other discouraging it.
Rehydration of brewing strains has, by com-parison with wine yeasts, attracted little attention. Jenkins et al. (2011) noted that ‘because of opera-tional  constraints  this  practice  (rehydration)  is often not adhered to when ADY is employed on an industrial scale’. Further, yeast viability was com-promised by incomplete rehydration, rehydration at suboptimal temperatures, or rehydration in wort. The authors suggest that for each commercial dried brewing yeast, there would be merit in establish-ing the optimum temperature for rehydration and accordingly viability.
Building on this, a variety of ‘additives’ have been evaluated in rehydration of dried wine yeasts. Given its seasonality of need, wine is a much bigger arena for ADY but reportedly has similar issues, namely ‘wineries tend to pay insuficient attention to the rehydration  process’  (Díaz-Hellín  et  al.,  2013). Well-reasoned additives including lipids (sterols and unsaturated fatty acids), antioxidants, vitamins, and metal ions have been evaluated (Díaz-Hellín et al., 2013; Vaudano et al., 2014) either without effect or where the response varied between strains. Whilst some authors have concluded that there is no ‘universal activator’ (Díaz-Hellín et al., 2013), others state that ‘no relationship was found between viability at the end of rehydration and fermentation performance’ (Vaudano et al., 2014).

Best practice
There is a clear, albeit niche opportunity for active dried brewer’s yeast. Top of the list of best practices are those actions that are geared to achieving and maintaining viability such as (i) cold storage and use within the ‘best before’ date, (ii) not storing part-opened packs and (iii) rehydrating to the letter of the manufacturer’s instructions. As with wet yeast fermentations, managing viable yeast pitching rate is a given and should be matched with wort gravity. The contribution of dissolved oxygen in wort is of interest, as on the face of it, aerobically fed-batch grown yeast has no immediate require-ment for oxygen. However, any dissolved oxygen
62 |  Quain


will be consumed once the yeast population initi-ates division and thereby may compensate for lower pitching rates than are desirable.

Consequences of failure
The primary consequence of failure in not applying best practice to the use of ADY is inconsistency. This should not be reconfigured as a virtue, as consistent processes deliver consistent products, a quality that the vast majority of beer consumers expect. Fermentations that are too fast or too slow (or incomplete) result in unpalatable and unbal-anced beers, which commercially can be ‘career threatening’!


Pitching
The inoculation or pitching of yeast into fermenter is one of three primary control factors in brewery fermentations. The other two, oxygen and tem-perature, are considered below (see section on ‘fermentation’). As noted above, brewery fermen-tations are peculiar in typically transferring yeast between successive fermentations. The eficiency of fermentation (i.e. ethanol production vs. new bio-mass) is indirectly managed by limiting new yeast growth through a combination of a relatively high pitching rate and availability of the nutrient oxygen. Achieving the desired balance of the two param-eters is central to delivering fermentation that is of the required rate and extent and, importantly, is consistent.
Yeast  pitching  rate  is  broadly  based  on  the maxim of 1×106 viable cells/ml for every 1° Plato of wort (O’Connor-Cox, 1998b). So at a wort grav-ity of 10° Plato the pitching rate is 10×106 viable cells/ml, 15×106 viable cells/ml at 15° Plato, and so on. Although by no means carved in stone, this approach – together with management of wort oxygen – provides a good base for optimal fermen-tation. Expectations include (i) new yeast growth (crop is 3- to 4-fold the amount of yeast pitched), (ii) required fermentation rate and extent (includ-ing diacetyl rest) (iii) desired flavour and aroma profile, and (iv) management of fob and cooling demand.
Increasing pitching rate has often been explored (e.g. Edelen et al., 1996; Erten et al., 2007; Ver-belen  et  al.,  2009).  As  ever,  the  experimental approach, scale, and pitching ‘multiple’ vary but

with consistent oxygen concentration, the process outcomes are broadly consistent. As would be antic-ipated, increasing the pitching rate results in faster fermentations with correspondingly higher and ear-lier peak yeast cell counts. The quantity of new yeast growth was unchanged irrespective of pitching rate as this is determined by the (fixed) concentration of oxygen. The combined (pitched+new) biomass obviously increased, resulting in greater losses of bitterness ‘bound’ to the yeast cell wall. Analysis of beer volatiles from such trials provides no clear, repeatable insights as to the impact of enhanced pitching rate. Given the lack of an experimental baseline, this is no great surprise.

Measurement of pitching rate
There are numerous methods for the measurement of yeast concentration for pitching into a fermenter (Table 3.4). In the past, the complexity, accuracy and cost of these methods was in accordance with the scale of operations. Today, the advent of cost-effective but sophisticated methods has enabled the ‘up-selling’ of more robust approaches to control yeast pitching rate. For the simplest approaches, the achievement of the desired pitching rate is ‘cheap and cheerful’. At its simplest, this may be x packs of dried yeast per vessel. Measurement of ‘weight’ or mass (variously dry, or wet/centrifuged) of ‘solids’ in yeast slurries enables a more controlled approach to yeast pitching. The dry yeast method is more accurate than wet, reflecting changes in cell size/ volume during fermentation (Boulton and Quain, 2001) and during yeast storage (Cahill et al., 1999). However, dry weights are not a practical real-time option unless using a microwave (Rice et al., 1980). However either method is complicated by the dis-traction of non-yeast solids such as trub and hop material.  The  quantitative  significance  of  either fraction can be assessed visually (assuming trans-parent tubes) as distinct bands after centrifugation before weighing or drying. Nevertheless, either approach results in the overestimation of weight and the underestimation of yeast mass. However, whichever approach is used it is strongly recom-mended that there is correction for yeast viability especially if this is less than 95%. This increases the accuracy of pitching rate and provides a key indication of yeast health and well-being. However, it should be noted that compensation for reduced viability results in the addition of more dead yeast,

which – through autolysis – will compromise beer quality.
The issue of non-yeast solids is overcome by measurement of yeast count as is or, better still, a viable count in conjunction with a vital stain such as methylene blue, the use of which dates back to 1933 (O’Connor-Cox et al., 1997). Together, they represent the de facto reference method by which other methods (below) are compared. The method requires a skilled and trained operator to juggle the use of a haemocytometer (aka Thoma chamber) and microscope. This is further compromised by the tedium of counting up to 1,000 cells (ASBC Methods of Analysis, 2011), which results in opera-tor fatigue when analysing numerous yeast samples. Accordingly,  an  automated  slide-based  counter using methylene blue has been developed with both enhanced consistency and reduced analysis time compared with the manual method (Thompson et al., 2015).
Whilst  both  weight  and  cell  numbers  have their advocates, especially from the perspective of simplicity, there are some caveats. Whilst trub adds inaccuracy to the measurement of solids, both approaches suffer from errors associated with the dificulties of representative sampling of thick yeast slurries (40% wet solids, ca 1.5×109 cells/ml) from storage vessels. Considerations include vessel scale, homogeneity (thorough mixing), sampling point

and sample size. Such sampling errors can then be further compounded by processing steps required for  testing,  such  as  the  small  slurry  volumes involved in serial dilution for cell counts.
As  would  be  anticipated,  the  driver  for  the improved control and accuracy of yeast pitching came from the bigger demands of large-scale fer-mentation management. Ideally, such an approach would be in-line, automated, control the pitching process and better still would ‘count’ only viable yeast. First up and reported by Riess (1986) was a system using near infra-red turbidometry. Two sensors measured the turbidity of the wort and of the pitched wort, thereby enabling a ‘set-point’ to be established and constant yeast count to be main-tained. The approach was commercialized and met with some success in achieving a tighter range of cell counts compared with the conventional pitch-ing control system. However, the downsides were the lack of correction for viability together with a lack of correction for non-yeast solids entrained in the injected yeast slurry (Boulton and Quain, 2001). Dark beers were also problematic, as haze measurement was more dificult (Noble, 1997).
The issue was neatly summarized by Harris and co-workers (1987) who observed that ‘an accurate method for the real-time estimation of microbial biomass during laboratory and industrial fermenta-tions remains an important goal’. The paper then
64 |  Quain


explored  the  use  of  radiofrequency  (RF)  and ‘concluded that measurement of RF permittivity provides an extremely powerful and convenient means for the assessment of microbial biomass, in situ and in real time’. On application of the radio-frequency electrical field, viable cells (with intact plasma  membranes)  become  charged  and  the measured capacitance reflects linearly the viable yeast concentration. Two years later, Boulton et al. (1989) reported the application of this technology to an automatic yeast pitching system that measured only viable yeast and was independent of any non-yeast solids. However and importantly, because cell size varies, the system required calibration against methylene blue cell counts for each yeast strain in use.
The exploitation of radiofrequency permittivity was undeniably a genuine process innovation and the Aber biomass meter (www.aber-instruments. co.uk) is used in breweries worldwide. Such systems are considered to control pitching rate to better than within ±2% of the target viable count (Boulton, 2006). Accordingly, demonstrable improvements have been reported in target pitching rate (Maca et al., 1994) and fermenter cycle time (Boulton and Quain, 2001; Carvell and Turner, 2003; Boulton, 2006).  Unsurprisingly,  there  have  been  range extensions to the use of the technology in control-ling pitching rate, including an off-line laboratory analyser and a mobile skid-based unit. Other appli-cations have included the control of yeast cropping together with monitoring propagation and fermen-tation, most notably in the distribution of yeast in cylindroconical vessels (Boulton et al., 2007).

Generation number
The number of times yeast is cycled between fer-mentations comes up from various perspectives throughout this chapter. Today, a more proactive management (10 to as low as 5 or fewer cycles) has succeeded the laissez-faire approach of 20 or more generations in the past. The drivers for this change are not entirely clear. Whilst hygiene and yeast han-dling are arguably better than in the past, awareness of genetic change is more pronounced and may contribute to this. A good and quantified explana-tion for this is reported by Stewart (2015). Over a period of 15 years in a North American brewing group, average wort gravities increased from 12 to 14 to 16 and finally to 18° Plato. In turn this was

accompanied by yeast generation numbers reduc-ing from >20 to 16 to 12 and finally to 8 cycles (Stewart, 2015). These changes were introduced over time to avoid ‘fermentation dificulties’ in rate and/or extent. Another study (Jenkins et al., 2003) reports for a (then) major UK brewer that company policy for maximum generation number of four production yeasts ranged from 10 (two strains) to eight and five.

A word or two on yeast viability
Viability is the key measure of yeast health in brew-ing and it is used to correct pitching rate, assess fermentation performance and the impact of in-pro-cess handling. As noted above, the ‘gold standard’ is the vital stain methylene blue, which is invari-ably used to benchmark and calibrate sophisticated methods such as radiofrequency permittivity and other up-and-coming methods. However, despite its position and longevity, methylene blue has its criticisms. Most notably, vital staining infers the cell is a metabolically viable cell but throws no light on whether the cell can divide and replicate. Accord-ingly, cell division is routinely tested by a functional test involving the plating of samples on nutrient agar. This approach is not ‘real time’ and takes two or more days incubation to enable a viable cell count. Additionally, plate counts do not necessar-ily support the growth of all microorganisms in the sample as the media is (intentionally) selective but also the organisms themselves may be physiologi-cally non-culturable for a host of reasons.
Given the debate about measuring yeast viabil-ity, it is (with hindsight) somewhat bizarre that an additional concept – vitality – has been added to the mix as a measure of yeast physiological state. Many diverse vitality tests have been proposed to ‘assess fitness of individual batches of yeast to pitch, either in a go, no-go approach, or as predictors of subsequent fermentation performance, which pref-erably allows selection of optimum pitching rates and/or wort oxygenation’ (Boulton, 2012). Tell-ingly, the same author concludes that ‘there is little evidence that they provide more information than a simple viability test such as the usual counting of unstained and stained cells treated with the vital dye methylene blue’.
Practically, rightly or wrongly the methylene blue method for yeast viability is firmly embedded in the global brewing industry. Perhaps we should

simply pick up on Johnny Mercer’s lyrics from 1945 and ‘accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative and latch on to the afirmative, do not mess with Mister In-between’.

Acid washing – yes or no?
Rather than beating about the bush, it is hard to offer a balanced, constructive view of acid wash-ing. Its use comes from a different time when yeast hygiene was a concern and ‘washing’ in (typically) food-grade phosphoric acid (pH 2.2) at 2–4°C with stirring for 2 hours dealt with the problem. For many, rather than being an occasional treatment, acid washing has became hardwired as part of the process irrespective of need or value. In terms of ‘need’,  today’s  awareness  of  the  importance  of hygiene, use of closed vessels and effective, vali-dated cleaning regimes has resulted in a step change in pitching yeast cleanliness. As to ‘value’, nothing here has really changed. Acid washing is only effec-tive in killing bacteria, or rather brewery bacteria. Extremophile acidophilic bacteria are associated with the mining of metals and coal and have a pH optimum for growth at (or below) pH 3.0 (John-son, 1988). If wild yeast or the wrong production yeast is the problem, then acid washing will not resolve things as generically ‘yeast’ is unaffected by the conditions.
Of course, saying that yeast is ‘unaffected’ by acid washing is debateable. In terms of homeostasis, maintenance of intracellular pH (around pH 7) has been reported in aerobically grown S. cerevisiae over an external pH range of 3–8 (Valkonen et al., 2013). More specifically, Simpson and Hammond (1989) noted that brewing yeasts were ‘inherently resistant to acid washing treatments but, under some condi-tions this resistance is diminished’. Interestingly the presence of ethanol (5 and 10% abv) had a marked effect on viability and ‘unhealthy’ yeast performed poorly.  Notably,  scanning  electron  microscopy revealed blistering of the cell wall.
A similar observation – ‘the cell surface was deformed’ – was made after incubating yeast in rich media at pH 2.5 (de Lucena et al., 2015). This work was triggered from washing yeast with sulfuric acid between fuel alcohol fermentations, as management of (lactic acid) bacteria is important to optimize ethanol production (Walker, 2011). Although a different approach, the conclusions from de Lucena et al. (2015) are directional in that acidification

with  sulfuric  acid  triggers  a  host  of  metabolic stress responses to repair the physical damage to the cell wall and maintain viability. Accordingly, it should be argued that routine or occasional acid washing selectively treats some of the symptoms (not the cause), is unnecessary where hygiene is well managed and is the cause of an additional and unnecessary stress to pitching yeast.

Best practice
Pitching rate along with wort oxygenation are the two pillars of successful and consistent fermenta-tions.  Irrespective  of  process  scale,  consistently pitching the required number of viable yeast cells is the focus of best practice. How that is delivered is driven by scale and budget. Although the ‘radi-ofrequency permittivity’ platform has a range of willing applications that will add value, for some a  microscope,  haemocytometer  and  vital  stain is suficient to deliver a consistent yeast pitching rate in fermenter. Other considerations are yeast viability,  which  directly  relates  to  the  manage-ment of the other parts of the yeast supply cycle. Generation number – as noted above – should also be proactively managed to 10 or less generations. From a process perspective, pitching of yeast into fermenter must accommodate the reality of lengthy fill times and multiple batches of wort. In terms of consistency, best practice is to pitch – if possible – all the required yeast into the first brewlength. This removes the small risk of wort contaminants taking hold and ensures that the entire yeast population behaves ‘as one’ in the transition from quiescence to growth.

Consequences of failure
In terms of failure there is a sliding scale of severity for failing to meet best practice recommendations for  yeast  pitching.  Underpitching  will  result  in a  sluggish  fermentation  performance,  which  – depending on degree – will be readily apparent. If this is due to pitching by mass with no understand-ing of the contribution of dead yeast, this will result in enhanced cell autolysis and untoward flavours and aromas. A comparable situation can occur running blind with the Aber technology, although increased pitching solids provides an early clue of an increasing dead cell fraction. Although significant overpitching will result in an ageing population of yeast cells, repeated repitching at an elevated rate is
66 |  Quain


unlikely to be a sustainable process. Stretching the maximum generation number is unpredictable and very much specific to the strain in question. The expectation is that this would over time increase the likelihood of sluggish fermentation and selection of variants. Extending yeast pitching from the first brewlength to most or all may be driven by practi-cal considerations or the belief that the approach improves mixing. Whatever the reasoning, extend-ing the pitching profile will result in inconsistency. Here the different batches of yeast will transition from quiescence to growth at different times and (depending how and when oxygen is added) differ-ing availability of oxygen. Competition for oxygen will also not be a ‘level playing field’ as the uptake rate increases over the time of exposure (Boulton, 2013). Consequently, subsequent batches of yeast will potentially be out-competed for oxygen by the more voracious appetite of the first pitching of yeast.


Fermentation
Fermentation is the heart and – with the exception of ‘continental’ maturation times (i.e. lagering) – the longest part of the brewing process. At a large scale,  the  cylindroconical  fermenter  is  far  and away the vessel of choice. The roots of the modern cylindroconical  vessels  (CCV)  stem  from  the remarkable work of Nathan presented at a meeting of the Institute of Brewing in London 86 years ago (Nathan, 1930). Whilst modest in scale (100hl), these aluminium vessels were designed as unitanks (both fermentation and maturation) with cooling jackets on the vessel. The vessel cone, which was also cooled, was introduced to improve mixing and thereby speed up fermentation as well presumably to catch trub and yeast! Other insights include the aeration of cold water and, after removal of the yeast, gas washing to remove the ‘jungbukett’ or young beer sulfury aromas. Maule (1986), in an engaging review, describes the evolution of fermenter design pre- and post-Nathan to the many and diverse con-tinuous systems.
Todays CCVs, although rooted in the Nathan’s design,  have  capacities  in  the  range  of  2000– 10,000hl and aspect ratios of between 1:3 and 1:5 (diameter to height). The smaller footprint is of course conducive to the creation of large tank farms.  Vessel  volumes  are  nominal,  as  there  is

10–15% freeboard (unfilled headspace) to retain foam within the vessel. Recovery of carbon dioxide from large fermenters is increasingly the norm. These large vessels have a number of distinct cool-ing jackets on the vessel as well as on the cone. With hygiene being ever more important, fermenters use more sophisticated and effective cleaning-in-place systems than Nathan’s use of alcohol vapour. In terms of the big picture, Hoggan (1977) flagged other benefits of CCVs as reduced capital, reduced running costs and losses together with increased flexibility. Good schematics of a typical CCV can be found in Boulton and Quain (2001) and Boul-ton (2006).
There  is  no  mystery  about  control;  get  the simple things right and the big things – i.e. fermen-tation – look after themselves. The ‘simple things’ are specific wort gravity, pitching rate and correct wort oxygenation. Yes, yeast viability/physiology is important, as is wort composition and tempera-ture, but the ‘simple things’ rule routinely. Here, the intent is not to replay excellent reviews on fermentation (Boulton, 2006; Lodolo et al., 2008; Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013; Boulton, 2013), but to focus on three areas; wort oxygen, yeast glycogen and vessel capacity.
In support of the narrative, Fig. 3.2 provides a timeline of some of the key events during fermenta-tion.

Oxygen
As noted above, the generally accepted guideline for pitching rate is 1×106 viable cells/ml for every 1° Plato of wort. A similar metric is used for wort oxygen with 1mg/l (ppm) for every 1° Plato of wort (Barnes, 2006). As with pitching, this is rule of thumb and a useful starting point for optimiza-tion. Functionally, as yeast has the requirement for oxygen, pitching rate is the real determinant of oxygen requirement. As ever, it may not be as simple as this! Early reports noted that both ale (Kirsop, 1974) and lager (Jacobsen and Thorne, 1980) strains can vary – from half air saturation to oxygen saturation or more – in the amount of oxygen they require for a successful fermentation.
In terms of process, oxygen is added under backpressure on the cold side of the wort cooler either as air or oxygen. Whilst the proportion of the oxygen in the gas phase is the bigger determinant, pressure together with wort temperature and solids

determine solubility. The solubility of oxygen or air in water at 25°C and 1 bar pressure is, respectively, 40 or 8mg/l. Accordingly, the concentration of oxygen in worts saturated with air at 15°P and 20°P is 6.3/5.5ppm at 15°C and 5.5/4.9 at 20°C (Kirsop, 1974). Given this, it is not surprising that wort oxygenation – rather than aeration – is the norm with  high-gravity  wort.  Although  typically  well controlled at the wort cooler, the actual concentra-tion of oxygen in fermenter may be lower due to gas breakout, especially if the vessel is some distance from the point of addition. As with yeast pitching regimes, multiple batches of wort allow different ‘tunes’ of oxygen addition. Addition to all or some of the wort batches may allow tuning but will inevi-tably add process complexity and opportunity for error.
Fundamentally, oxygen determines the extent of yeast growth by enabling the synthesis of sterols and mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Too little and there is insuficient lipid synthesis and consequently insuf-ficient yeast growth and incomplete fermentation. Too much oxygen – should it remain available once the cells begin to divide – can result in unrequired additional lipid synthesis and unnecessary yeast growth. As yeast growth impacts negatively on the formation of ethanol, unnecessary yeast growth reduces the fermentation eficiency. These interac-tions are demonstrated experimentally in Fig. 3.3.

Oxygen and lipid synthesis
Under the anaerobic conditions of fermentation, brewing yeast becomes auxotrophic for sterols and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (UFA). The oxygen added to wort is used by yeast in the synthesis of these key lipids at the beginning of fermentation.

During anaerobiosis, these lipids are progressively diluted during cell division so that cells at the end of the process are lipid ‘depleted’ and once more auxotrophic (Fig. 3.4). The provision of excessive dissolved oxygen does not result in additional syn-thesis of these lipids as these pathways are highly regulated  by  various  feedback  control  systems, which conversely are induced when sterol levels are low. Consequentially, it is wise to tune the oxygen concentration to broadly meet the ‘needs’ of the pitching yeast, as excess and unused oxygen may result in wort oxidative reactions that may damage beer quality. In passing, it is worth noting that in brewery fermentations yeast metabolism is purely fermentative  and  that  respiration  and  oxidative phosphorylation are not possible. This is a function of the overarching catabolite repression from the fermentable sugars in wort.
The building block for both sterols and fatty acids is acetyl-CoA, the key metabolic intermediary stemming from glycolysis. Of the 20 or so steps from acetyl-CoA to the end product ergosterol, the initial steps to the hydrocarbon squalene do not require oxygen. The steps between squalene and ergosterol require 12 molecules of oxygen for every molecule of ergosterol. In the absence of oxygen, squalene accumulates in anaerobic yeast so as to facilitate sterol synthesis on the provision of oxygen. With UFA, the requirement is one to one. Quantitatively compared to content of sterols, total fatty acids are 5- to 10-fold higher, with UFA content 3-fold or so greater (Rosenfeld and Beauvoit, 2003). For an excellent review on yeast lipid metabolism see Klug and Daum (2014).
Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are the basic elements of phospholipids and sphingolipids.

These  are  complex  amphipathic  lipids  that  are important in biological membrane structure and function.  Similarly,  sterols  are  essential  for  cell viability and are key components of the plasma and organelle membranes where they affect fluidity/ rigidity, permeability and protein functionality. In excess, both free sterols and fatty acids can be toxic, so they are sequestered and stored as steryl esters and triacylglycerols in subcellular lipid droplets. With cell division during fermentation (which typi-cally is complete by the mid-point), the sterol esters are converted to free sterols (and UFA) that are transported to the required location in membranes. It has long been known (Andreasen and Stier,

1953)  that  anaerobic  lipid-depleted  yeast  will take up exogenous ergosterol dispersed in UFA (oleic acid, C18:1) so as to resume growth and fermentation.  Addition  of  ergosterol  in  lipid-free detergent to all-malt wort (10°P) supported anaerobic growth (David, 1973), suggesting that anaerobic yeast requires sterol but not UFA for growth. Practically, this is of interest as worts con-tain lipids, notably stearic acid (C18:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2), which is not made by yeast. However, wort  separation/filtration  and  particularly  boil-ing/clarification remove most of the lipid, with an estimated 0.1–3% of malt lipids surviving through to the pitching wort (Kühbeck et al., 2006). The
Yeast Supply, Fermentation and Handling |  69


extent of ‘supplementation’ by linoleic acid can only be speculated upon and will depend on wort con-centration, malt content and clarity (turbid worts usually contain more lipid). Uptake of linoleic acid would be expected to be total, as when added (to suppress ester formation) at 50mg/l to a 10°P all-malt ale wort it is fully taken up with 18 hours of fermentation (with 70% in 4 hours) (Thurston et al., 1982). Sterol esters account for only 3% of the total lipid reported in pitching worts (Anness and Reed, 1985) so, in accord with David (1973), wort contains insuficient sterol to spare the need for endogenous synthesis.
Quantitatively, total sterol in pitching yeast rep-resents ca 0.1% dry biomass and peaks at around 1% dry biomass following oxygenation. With three or four rounds of cell division, the sterol content declines in anaerobic yeast to that found in pitching yeast (Aries and Kirsop, 1978). Qualitatively, the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in pitching yeast is 20% or so, increasing to ca 56% post expo-sure to oxygen and then diluted out by growth to the initial level (Thurston et al., 1982).

Glycogen
In anaerobic yeast, polysaccharides are quantita-tively bigger than the collective protein component. Of these, glucan, mannan and chitin perform a structural role in the cell wall, whereas glycogen is a reserve or storage polysaccharide that can be mobi-lized when required to provide metabolic energy. Glycogen  is  a  high-molecular-weight  branched polymer  of  α-d-glucose  located  in  the  cytosol (‘bodies’) and vacuole (Wilson et al., 2010) with a ‘pool’ associated with the cell wall (Gunja-Smith et al., 1977; Deshpande et al., 2011). Regulation of glycogen synthesis and dissimilation is complex and has been reviewed by Wilson et al. (2010). Its particular claim to fame has been somewhat dis-missively described as ‘at the beginning of industrial fermentation procedure stored glycogen is rapidly degraded, while it accumulates once fermentation is complete (Feldman, 2012).
It has long been known that accumulated car-bohydrate reserves in anaerobic yeast are rapidly broken down on exposure to oxygen (Chester, 1963). In a brewing context (Quain et al., 1981), glycogen is rapidly broken down after pitching into oxygenated wort, only to reaccumulate during active fermentation before the cycle repeats. The

amount of glycogen at the end of fermentation is substantial and is about 30% of the dry biomass (less specific methods of analysis probably over report). On exposure to oxygen, glycogen accounts for <5% of the dry weight. This rapid mobiliza-tion of glycogen has been linked to providing the metabolic energy for the synthesis of new sterols and  unsaturated  fatty  acids.  The  key  argument for this is that the plasma membrane in anaerobic yeast is lipid depleted with limited functionality for transport of wort nutrients (e.g. sugars). Detailed measurement of glucose, sucrose, fructose and spe-cific gravity during the anaerobic-aerobic transition would appear to support this hypothesis (Quain and Tubb, 1982). Subsequent work (Quain et al., 1981) demonstrated a linear relationship between glycogen  breakdown  and  sterol  synthesis.  The apparent fuelling of sterol synthesis by glycogen in turn triggered an awareness of the need to maintain glycogen levels in pitching yeast. Conditions such as a protracted storage in the fermenter cone or in storage vessel have been shown by many workers to result in glycogen breakdown although at a much slower rate than on exposure to oxygen (e.g. Quain and  Tubb,  1982;  McCaig  and  Bendiak,  1985; Powell et al., 2004: Somani et al., 2012).
The ‘glycogen story’ makes intuitive sense but the  experimental  techniques  and,  in  particular, analysis was of its time. To the author’s knowledge, there has been no more sophisticated analysis to connect  more  literally  glycogen  breakdown  to sterol synthesis. The expression of the sterol bio-synthetic genes (ERG) has been reported to be up-regulated shortly after pitching (Higgins et al., 2003; Rautio et al., 2007). However, there are no reports as to the expression of glycogen phosphory-lase  (GPH1)  or  debranching  enzyme  (GDB1) post-pitching. A more likely explanation is that these enzymes are already ‘present and able’, as can be inferred from the slow dissimilation of glycogen during storage. Intriguingly, a recent paper (Gsell et al., 2015) has shown that deletion of GPH1, the gene for glycogen-mobilizing enzyme, results in decreased levels of sterol esters, triacylglycerols and other lipids. Clearly, this is work in progress and the authors conclude that ‘Gph1p may fulfil multiple independent functions which affect carbohydrate metabolism on the one hand and lipid metabolism on the other hand’.

Capacity
Breweries big and small have a ‘pinch point’ – a combination of capacity and time – that limits end-to-end output. Long-established breweries are often balanced with suficient capacity across the process to accommodate peaks and troughs. How-ever, commercial pressures such as brand growth, rationalization, brewery takeovers and, pertinently, global consolidation of large companies has driven the need to enhance production capacity without capital investment in new tanks and associated utilities infrastructure. This is not a new concept. Nathan (1930) noted that ‘as fewer vessels were needed by his process the installation was about one-third cheaper than the old lager beer system, as a finished beer of 1,048° could be turned out in about 12 days, as compared with 3 or 4 months under the lager system’.
Following the Second World War, the biggest and most sustainable game-changer was the introduc-tion of high-gravity brewing. Rather than brewing at ‘sales gravity’, worts are collected at a high grav-ity, the precise definition of which has changed over time. These worts are fermented ‘as is’ and maturated before dilution to sales gravity post-filtration. Of the various process expectations, one – no alteration in beer flavour or quality – was sacrosanct, although others (no reduction in brewlength, little or no cap-ital expenditure, no additional complexity) would be typically assumed! As can be appreciated, the benefits of growing capacity output without capital expenditure are highly attractive and over time have driven small incremental changes in wort gravity. A modest example over some years would be moving collection gravities (°P) from 9 to 10 to 12, 13, 14.5, 15, 15.5 and 16 and beyond. The holy grail of 20°P fermentations is achievable as a one-off but beyond that massively more challenging. Against a back-drop of consumer acceptance via sales performance or directly through ‘hall tests’, increasing collection gravity eventually reaches its own ‘pinch point’. Typically, brewhouse performance becomes limit-ing and there is only so far ‘extending’ worts with sugar syrups can go in terms of yeast performance and beer quality. Indeed, the original wake-up call on high gravity brewing came from matching 10°P and 20°P worts where esters were disproportional-ity elevated at (very) high gravity. Whilst at the time a concern, the key insight to control ester produc-tion at high gravity required that yeast growth to be

matched through management of wort oxygenation and yeast pitching rate.
Although the capacity gains through high-grav-ity brewing have become a fact of brewing life, the law of diminishing returns inevitably begins to play. Whilst this will include numerous factors such yeast strain robustness, malt/sugar ratio, beer complexity and consumer acceptance, there invariably comes a tipping point. This may be manifest in fermentation performance, viability, generation number or beer attributes  (appearance,  consistency,  off-flavours) which taken together suggest that pushing the high-gravity envelope has reached the end of the road. Indeed at this point, reigning back to a lower, high gravity would be advisable.
Gravity is not the only tune to play. Alongside the march to ever-increasing gravities, fermentation temperature has also been questioned. The rules of the game – notably lager fermentations at com-paratively low temperatures – have been challenged both in terms of the end game but also the steps in between. Whilst the traditional lagers stay true to their history of low fermentation temperatures and extended maturation times, other lager brands have moved over 10 to 20 years from fermentation at 12°C (or lower) to 15°C, 18°C or higher with concomitantly reduced maturation times. It is note-worthy that increasing the maximum fermentation temperature has not been subject to as much study as increasing collection gravity. Those publications that report the inevitable acceleration of fermen-tation do so from a laboratory scale rather than production perspective. This most probably reflects concerns and sensitivity around the brands, which is understandable. However, as with extending collec-tion gravities, increasing fermentation temperature brings stress, which combined with high gravity, results in an accumulation of environmental chal-lenges that impact on yeast performance and beer quality. Indeed, it is the long-term consequences of a high-gravity, high-temperature regime that take time to manifest the combined impact on yeast quality. Accordingly, taking time out to reflect on process change and its implications on a periodic basis would be recommended.
Increasing fermentation temperature increases the  rate  of  fermentation.  A  less  controversial approach, which achieves the same objective, is to introduce effective vessel mixing. Whilst making eminent sense, brewery fermentations in CCVs
Yeast Supply, Fermentation and Handling |  71


have long been considered as being well mixed during active fermentation. This splendid series of experiments at a production scale as reviewed by Boulton (2013), clearly demonstrate the het-erogeneity of fermentations and the advantages of introducing an effective mixing process. Implemen-tation of a commercial mixing system (‘Iso-Mix’) has an undeniable positive impact on fermentation cycle times, VDK reduction and crash cooling of the vessel.

Best practice
Without fermentation, brewing and other indus-tries would not exist. The cyclical nature of brewery fermentations is unforgiving and requires a more sustainable attention to detail to ensure consistency. Whatever the production scale, a combination of the right viable pitching yeast and the right wort oxygen content will normally assure both a consist-ent fermentation profile and required beer quality. The onus is on the brewer to tune both variables and, accordingly, to know the normal operating parameters for the plant and yeast. Inevitably an awareness, understanding and implementation of best practice in the up- and downstream processes are part of the bigger fermentation picture.

Consequences of failure
Fermentation is the culmination of a series of events. The back-story of yeast pitching to fermentation and back again exacerbates process and product problems. Failure to manage either yeast pitching rate in concert with wort oxygenation results in a raft of issues. Given that process consistency is a laudable ambition, drift of either parameter will result in atypical fermentation and atypical product quality. Whilst blending provides a short-term solu-tion, the longer-term ambition should be to achieve consistency.


Cropping
At it simplest, the outputs of the cropping process are the recovery of suficient yeast from the fer-menter cone to pitch two or more fermenters. A key requirement is that the cropped yeast is of the required physiological and microbiological qual-ity. Important process considerations include the flocculence of the yeast being recovered, manage-ment of cooling, vessel size and shape, cone angle

and cropping ‘philosophy’. It is a low-key process, a routine recovery of biomass at the end, or near the end, of the transformational conversion of wort to beer. In essence, yeast cropping is a support pro-cess and on the face of it not very interesting! First impressions, though, can be deceptive. As with all the steps in the journey of yeast from propagation/ pitching through fermentation to storage (and back again), the cropping process can impact positively or – if performed poorly – can cause irreparable harm to yeast quality.
Arguably, visibility is a part of the problem. Irrespective of size and volume, the CCV is nigh on  universally  the  choice  of  fermenter  shape. Whilst undeniably good for hygiene and building footprint,  cylindroconical  fermenters  offer  few visual clues (other than overfoaming!) as to what is happening inside the vessel. Perhaps out of sight and out of mind, but despite its importance, yeast recovery  from  the  cone  of  cylindroconical  fer-menters has not received a fair press. Sporadic but accumulating evidence paints a persuasive picture that the environment in the vessel cone is highly damaging to yeast physiology and viability. Further, assumptions about mixing (carbon dioxide and convection) are optimistic and as Boulton (2013) has shown, more yeast ‘sits’ in the cone and arrives there earlier than was thought. Yeast located in the cone is in the wrong place and contributes little or nothing to sugar utilization, diacetyl reduction and the overall progress of fermentation. Conversely, the ‘composting’ of yeast in the vessel cone together with associated autolysis impacts negatively on beer (and yeast!) quality.

The cropping process
There is not an agreed universal fermenter design; an observation that is frequently reinforced when visiting breweries. Ideally, the CCV can be inde-pendently cooled to minimize the development of  hostile  conditions  that  damage  the  cropped yeast. Typically to aid stratification and rundown, the included cone angle is 60 or 70° but flatter or steeper cones are not uncommon. Practically, there are a limited number of processing options yeast cropping from the cone. Firstly and foremost is whether to recover the entire crop or to focus recovery on a particular fraction or ‘cut’ so as to select the best yeast. Perhaps the most universal approach (Noble, 1997; O’Connor-Cox, 1997) is
72 |  Quain


to recover the ‘middle cut’ whilst discarding the first runnings, which are rich in trub and dead yeast and (if they are there) enriched with flocculent yeast variants whose selection can cause process-ing problems (see ‘Population heterogeneity and genetic instability’). The first cut or cold break is either removed within a day or so of fermentation commencing or more usually as part of the crop-ping process itself. The uppermost ‘fuzzy’ fraction is often specifically not recovered during cropping, as it is lower in solids and enriched in small chrono-logically young cells together with potentially less flocculent yeast.
The process of yeast recovery can be controlled in a variety of ways ranging from a standard volu-metric cut-off, visual assessment, use of turbidity sensors or, better still, application of an in-line viable biomass probe as used to manage pitch-ing yeast (see above). Cropping from the vessel cone is managed via an appropriate pump. Less common is the recovery of powdery, less floccu-lent yeast by centrifugation. With such yeast this process is unavoidable, but the approach requires capital (for the centrifuge and in-line cooler), adds complexity and is comparatively energy intensive. Cropping from the top of a cylindroconical vessel is unusual and is a demanding process hygieni-cally.  Whatever  the  approach  taken  to  recover cropped yeast, it is preferably stored as slurry in dedicated chilled and mixed yeast storage tanks (see ‘Storage’, below).
As elsewhere in brewing, time and tempera-ture are key variables of yeast cropping. Typically, where diacetyl reduction is managed in fermenter, yeast is cropped as the final process activity after VDK  specification  is  achieved  and  the  vessel

contents have been cooled. Such ‘cold’ cropping prolongs yeast residence time in fermenter and in doing so inevitably results in more physiologically damaged yeast. An alternative approach with suit-ably flocculent yeast is to practice ‘warm’ cropping (Noble,  1997;  O’Connor-Cox,  1997;  Loveridge et al., 1999). Here, yeast cropping is independent of diacetyl reduction and occurs sooner (rather than later) after fermentation has achieved racking gravity (usually 24 hours) but before cooling is applied. The advantage of this approach is that the yeast is cropped two or more days earlier – with the attendant benefit to yeast quality – but with the additional process complexity of a second crop (that goes to waste) prior to beer transfer. The time-lines for cold and warm cropping are compared in Fig. 3.5.

Impact of warm cropping on yeast quality
The  benefits  of  warm  cropping  were  clearly demonstrated in extensive production trials (Lov-eridge et al., 1999) at 2000hl and 4000hl scale. In all, 600 vessels were involved, with 180 warm cropped and the remainder cropped cold. The use of early warm cropping had a marked impact on yeast quality (crop solids, improved viability and consistency) and accordingly reduced fermenta-tion cycle time and faster VDK reduction (Table 3.5). Further work (Quain et al., 2001) focused in greater detail on both warm and cold cropping by sampling ‘500kg fractions’ during rundown in 2000hl fermenters. Not unexpectedly, in the yeast cropped ‘cold’, hotspots were observed with slurry temperature ranging between 1°C and 8°C in the vessel nominally at 4°C. Further, there was a linear

relationship between increasing yeast solids and abv (7% at low solids to ca 9% abv at 50% in the early runnings). The most telling comparison was viability, which was markedly higher in the warm cropped yeast (91.1±1.6%) than the control cold crop (83.4±3.3%). Irrespective of which cropping approach was used, there was evidence of stratifi-cation and heterogeneity of yeast in the fermenter cone. Parameters such as abv, pH, yeast solids and viability increased towards the base of the cone, whereas beer specific gravity increases towards the top of the cone. Unexpectedly, yeast flocculence (irrespective of cold or warm cropping) peaks at the mid-point of the cone as opposed to the vessel bottom. Prior to this, the perceived wisdom was that that flocculence decreases from bottom to top of the cone.
A sister publication (Powell et al., 2004) pro-vided further insight into yeast quality in the cone, demonstrating that levels on the intracellular stor-age  polysaccharide  glycogen  increased  linearly from the first to last fractions of cropped yeast. Conversely, glycogen breakdown would contribute to the higher abv towards the cone bottom. Analysis of cell size during cropping clearly showed size to reduce across the cropping process. Cell age was also monitored and was found to peak at the mid-point of cropping with yeast of greatest flocculence. As would be expected, small virgin cells predomi-nate at the end of cropping.
Thiele et al. (2008) compared warm and cold cropping at a production scale at two different breweries with lower collection gravities (12°P and 11°P) than the 15°P above. This report – which included  assessment  of  yeast  vitality  or  vigour using acidification power – suggested yeast quality to be broadly consistent across the cone. However, crop quality varied within and between breweries and the authors report that ‘environmental condi-tions in the cone cause severe stress to yeast and

therefore an early yeast crop can help to maintain healthy yeast’.

Autolysis
The environment in the cone of the fermenter vessel will result in some degree of autolysis by intracellular enzymes in dead yeast cells. A host of environmental factors contribute to autolysis including  temperature,  pH,  osmotic  pressure, ethanol, and starvation. Autolysis has been char-acterized  in  two  stages:  (i)  the  degradation  of organelles with the content uniformly distributed within the cell of reduced size; and (ii) hydrolysis of intracellular biopolymers, resulting in the diffusion of hydrolysis products through a porous cell wall into the medium (Babayan and Bezrukov, 1985). The products of autolysis are diverse and include polysaccharides (but not sugars), organic acids, protein, amino acids, fatty acids, nucleic acid prod-ucts and lipids (Hernawan and Fleet, 1995). The remains of the autolysed cell are primarily cell wall and membrane material called ‘ghosts’ or ‘hulls’ in the wine industry (Munoz and Ingledew, 1990).
As noted by Thorn in 1971 ‘the subject of autolysis is often not a major aspect of publications dealing  with  fermentation  and  yeast  handling’. Whilst arguably still true in brewing, there has been considerable interest in the world of wine where it is stored on ‘lees’ consisting mainly of yeast cells (Charpentier, 2010). It is noticeable that in brewing, autolysis ‘may lead to off-flavours and should be avoided’ (Thorn, 1971) whereas in wine it is positively encouraged in some wine styles and commercial products derived from autolysis are sometimes added. This creates something of a quandary. In terms of negatives, autolysis is linked with short chain fatty acids (Chen et al., 1980), contributing unwelcome ‘yeasty’ or ‘fatty’ aromas to beer, as well as hazes via glycogen (Malcorp et al., 2001) or mannan (Siebert et al., 1987). On
74 |  Quain


the other hand, the contribution is encouraged of mannoproteins, peptides, amino acids, nucleotides and nucleosides to the stability and organoleptic properties of wine (Charpentier, 2010). Of particu-lar interest is the release of sterols during autolysis (Hernawan and Fleet, 1995) that, together with the provision of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids from yeast hulls (Munoz and Ingledew, 1990) sug-gests an unexpected upside from cell digestion. As noted above, anaerobic yeast normally forms these lipids in the presence of oxygen but will take them up exogenously should they be available. The insight from the addition of yeast hulls to wine fermenta-tions suggests that these lipids may be recycled from autolysed yeast to the benefit of viable yeast. It would be interesting to test this hypothesis in brewery fermentations.

Best practice
Although the yeast storage process follows cropping, ‘storage’ effectively begins when yeast sediments (often) early in fermentation into the cone. Accord-ingly, best practice is to use effective cone cooling (2–4°C), remove the first cut of dead yeast plus trub and practice warm cropping to remove yeast to a more controlled and homogeneous environment in a storage vessel. The importance of early warm cropping increases with high (15°P) and very high (>15°P) gravity fermentations. A similar argument applies to the use of higher temperature fermenta-tions (to accelerate rate). Although cropping is often managed manually (visually or by time), there is value in the use of ‘radiofrequency permittivity’ technology to better manage viable yeast solids.

Consequences of failure
Rapid  yeast  cropping  minimizes  the  inevitable damage to yeast that occurs during this process. Arguably the conditions in the fermenter cone are the most damaging that yeast experience in the fer-mentation cycle. Prolonged residence in the cone results in metabolic ‘hot spots’ where the local tem-perature can increase markedly. Here, the reserve polysaccharide glycogen is dissimilated to glucose, which through glycolysis is converted to ethanol, ATP and heat. As the local temperature rises, the rate of glycogen break down increases, resulting in the formation of more heat. The insulating effect of thick yeast slurries reduces heat dissipation and results in the hot spot getting hotter and bigger.

These events result in a spiral of decline encourag-ing glycogen breakdown, ethanol formation, heat generation and inevitably loss of yeast viability. If this was not bad enough, there are environmental graduations radiating from hotspot(s) where yeast cells retain viability but have reduced levels of gly-cogen, which may compromise performance in the upcoming fermentation.


Storage
For such an influential process, ‘storage’ has in recent years had a poor press compared to the other players of propagation, pitching, cropping and the juggernaut of fermentation. The big picture of what best practice looks like for yeast storage is gener-ally agreed. However, practically, it is relatively untouched by new knowledge despite the signifi-cant strides in activity and understanding of relevant topics. Indeed as 80% of the earth’s environments exhibit temperatures below 5°C, responses of yeast to ‘cold’ (shock, stress and response) are in scope as is quiescence (‘the most common cell state on earth’) and near-zero growth rates. Here and where appropriate, these subjects are touched (lightly) on. See Chapter 1 for further discussion of quiescence.
In  her  seminal  series  of  three  articles  on ‘improving yeast handling in the brewery’, Erin O’Connor-Cox (1997, 1998a,b) used the memora-ble strapline, ‘keep it cold, keep it short and keep it simple’. Not surprisingly, as little has changed, from the viewpoint of yeast storage this is as wise a maxim today as it was then. Yeast storage is about maintaining the status quo and minimizing meta-bolic activity, physiological change or, worse still, death. The bottom line is that yeast storage can – at best – only maintain viability and in reality it will inevitably decline with time!
Yeast storage is a key cog in the wheel of the brewing yeast handling ‘cycle’. Hygienic cropping of yeast from fermenter and its hygienic storage as a slurry in a cooled, stirred vessel is a ‘given’ and is embedded in best practice. Storage of a pressed cake or slurry in ‘bins’ (hopefully in a cold room) is very much less than ideal and should be avoided or be part of an improvement plan towards the above best practice. The once fashionable option of stor-age in the fermenter cone cannot be recommended in any shape or form. Indeed, residence time of yeast in the cone should as little as is practical as
Yeast Supply, Fermentation and Handling |  75


this environment is most detrimental to yeast qual-ity (see ‘Cropping’).

Time, temperature and mixing
The object of yeast storage is to minimize the inevi-table deterioration of nutrient-limited, stationary phase,  lipid-depleted  yeast  ex  fermentation.  As summarized below (best practice), this is achieved through careful control of temperature (cold but without the risk of freezing), time (the shorter the better), mixing (to assure homogeneity) and minimizing oxygen pick-up (nitrogen gas blanket). Further, with increasingly high collection gravities and  consequently  high  abv,  dilution  of  slurries with sterile water is to be recommended. Whilst beneficial to the maintenance of yeast viability, the barriers to implementation include the unavailabil-ity of water of the right microbiological quality and impact on yeast storage capacity of diluted slurries. Despite this, dilution of yeast slurries is increasingly found in the mix of best practice.
It is also worth noting that there are a number of variables specific to the yeast being stored, which add a layer of further complexity to the process. These inevitably include brewing strain variabil-ity but also slurry thickness, generation number, cropping technique, cooling and barm-ale quality (including the aforementioned abv). Of the physi-cal inputs, time and temperature are in the front seat of the management of yeast storage. Whilst temperature control and its achievement through mixing are delivered through good process control, ‘time management’ is more subjective.
All things being equal, there is general accept-ance that storage time should be ideally <2 days but no more than 4 days. In routine practice this is more than achievable, although there will be occa-sions when storage time is stretched beyond four days. The bigger challenge is managing storage time for yeasts used infrequently for niche brands. Such protracted storage, whilst a considered option, will inevitably result in reduced yeast viability and, equally importantly, will also tie up a storage vessel. This scenario has driven workarounds such as the use of dried yeast (which lends itself to ‘one-off’ fermentations)  or,  regrettably,  culling  of  niche strains and replacement with a mainstream yeast. Less  dramatic  approaches  have  been  proposed to successfully prolong the duration of yeast stor-age. These include the addition of wort (Henson

and Reid, 1988; Kunze, 2014) and (memorably in response to the threat of a fuel crisis in 1947), slurrying yeast in potassium dihydrogen phosphate (Bishop et al., 1955).
The recommended temperature range for yeast storage is 2–4°C. There are a number of challenges here as yeast cropped from fermenter is – despite even effective cone cooling – invariably warmer in viscous slurries of 40% or so solids, which in turn are dificult to cool. Overlaid on this is the inaccuracy – also observed in fermenter cones – of temperature probes adjacent to the cooled vessel wall that fail to reflect the temperature of the slurry in the body of the vessel. Ideally, yeast slurries are cooled via an in-line heat exchanger to achieve more homogeneous temperatures on rundown from fermenter. Without such intervention, the transition from fermenter cone temperature to storage at 2–4°C is slower, more demanding and unpredictable.
Whatever the ‘prehistory’, the norm for yeast storage vessels is for mixing, ideally via an internal top-mounted, off-centred stirrer/agitator or more rarely through a recirculation loop. Whilst the key driver is to minimize slurry and environmental heterogeneity,  mixing  also  degasses  entrapped carbon dioxide. This is something of double-edged sword as, with the FV cone, a lack of temperature homogeneity results in ‘hot spots’ which step-up metabolism through glycogen breakdown resulting in formation of carbon dioxide (and ethanol).
Successful mixing of thick yeast slurries is not straightforward. Vessel design, slurry rheology and location of the mixer require careful consideration. As noted by O’Connor-Cox (1998b) ‘many mixers are designed such that they effect slurry move-ment in a limited area of the tank’, such that ‘the bulk of the slurry remains unmixed’. In particular, side-entry stirrers in the vessel cone were noted as ‘unsuitable’, whereas off-centre, top-mounted stir-rers were more successful. Other studies are few and far between. Cahill et al. (2003) in a landmark publication reported a detailed study of the impact of  mixing  on  temperature,  viability  and  yeast solids in a 10hl customized storage vessel. Here mixing was evaluated both in situ via a hygienically designed off-centred variable-speed agitator or with pumped recirculation from the base of the vessel to the top. Temperature was monitored by a 4×4 array of probes across the central belt of the vessel at different distances from the wall. The conclusions
76 |  Quain


from this work with a top-fermenting ale strain were unequivocal. Mechanical mixing at 200 rpm was key to homogeneity of slurry temperature, which contributed to yeast viability (maintenance and consistency), distribution of solids and vessel volume. By contrast, external recirculation of the vessel (over either 30 minutes or 2 hours) resulted in heterogeneity and could not be recommended with any confidence. Sufice to say, conditions were much worse in the absence of any mixing whatso-ever!

Growth, metabolism, stress and quiescence
Cropped yeast at the end of fermentation is meta-bolically in a non-growing, stationary phase. As a process, yeast storage is akin to the refrigeration of food insomuch that the lower temperature will markedly slow down metabolism and deterioration in ‘quality’. Growth is not a realistic consideration at typical storage temperatures of 2–4°C, Saccharo-myces (as a mesophile) is at or below the minimum temperature for growth. Indeed, even under opti-mum growth conditions – which yeast storage in beer clearly fails to achieve – doubling times are 50 hours or more at 4°C (Homma et al., 2003; Murata et al., 2006) and 42–63 hours at the higher temperature of 6°C (Walsh and Martin, 1977). This would, in turn, be further extended by the presence of significant levels of ethanol, which adversely impacts on the growth rate of yeast (Sá-Correia and Van Uden, 1983).
Yeast metabolism is muted during storage, as extracellular, assimilable nutrients are few and far between in slurry held in beer or ‘barm ale’. Indeed not  surprisingly,  the  viability  of  yeast  declines during storage. Temperature is key with viability declining  progressively  more  rapidly  as  storage temperatures increase from between 1°C to 5°C, from 5°C to 10°C, 10°C to 15°C and so on (McCaig and Bendiak, 1985). Overlaid on this, viability is linked to the concentration of extracellular ethanol, and is increasingly compromised above 7% abv (Loveridge et al., 1999). Breakdown of glycogen – the quantitatively important reserve polysaccha-ride – is also an inevitable consequence of storage (Quain and Tubb, 1982; McCaig and Bendiak, 1985), the rate of which is accelerated by increasing temperature. As with storage in the fermenter cone, glycogen dissimilation via fermentation results in

the formation of ethanol, which adds to that pre-sent in the barm ale.
Analysis (Gibson et al., 2007) of the various stresses that brewing yeast are exposed to during fermentation and handling identified ‘cold shock’ (and ethanol toxicity) as a major concern during yeast storage at 2–4°C. Of course, the size of the shift in temperature and rate of change will vary depending on fermentation temperature, cropping regime, eficacy of cone cooling and in-line cooling on transfer to storage vessel. As noted by Somani et al. (2012), ‘the impact of thermal downshift on brewing yeast has not been the subject of exten-sive investigation. This is surprising in light of the routine application of low-temperature storage to brewing yeast during industrial handling’. What little work has been published is directional in terms of the yeast storage process, as the insight comes from laboratory experiments with haploid yeast (Homma et al., 2003). Importantly in terms of relevance to storage, this work involved the growth – albeit slowly – of yeast aerobically at 4°C. As is the way with DNA microarray, a host of genes were either up- or down-regulated. Although reflecting growth and not a shift from (say) 30°C to 10°C, cold shock genes were typically (although not exclusively) up-regulated. Tellingly, the authors note that their work ‘suggests that long-term stor-age without growth would be preferable to growth at low temperature’.
In  a  follow-up  study  (Murata  et  al.,  2006), yeast was cultured at 25°C then transferred to 4°C after which gene expression was monitored over 6–48 hours. Again, the work was with a haploid laboratory strain and was aerobic. Responses to the downshift in temperature to 4°C include an upshift in the synthesis of phospholipid, trehalose, glycogen and cold shock mannoproteins located in the yeast cell wall. In response to the switch in temperature, the authors conclude that ‘trehalose and glycogen were synthesized for cold tolerance and energy preservation, and the synthesis of phos-pholipid and mannoproteins was for maintenance of cell membranes and permeability of cell wall’.
Stored  yeast  is  in  stationary/resting  phase
or in cell cycle terms G0 or G zero. Such cells are
also ‘quiescent’, which is described as the ‘most common and, arguably, most poorly understood cell cycle state’ (Allen et al., 2006). Quiescent cells are characterized as maintaining viability under
Yeast Supply, Fermentation and Handling |  77


growth-arrested  conditions,  having  a  decreased metabolic rate, exhibiting greater stress resistance and resuming growth when growth-promoting con-ditions return (Klosinska et al., 2011). Candidates for growth arresting conditions include starvation, stress and the accumulation of growth-inhibiting metabolites. Of course, such conditions sum-up those found in the stationary phase environment at the end of brewery fermentations.
However, once again, insight is at best direc-tional  as  studies  on  quiescence  in  yeast  are invariably in aerobic liquid cultures undergoing nutrient starvation (nitrogen, carbon and less det-rimentally sulfur and phosphate) or diauxic shift from the metabolism of glucose to ethanol. Despite this there are numerous fascinating and stimulating insights into the world of quiescence. Although from the related world of an aerobic culture, it has been shown that not all yeast cells in the stationary phase of (non) growth are quiescent (Allen et al., 2006). Using density gradient centrifugation, the population was separated into (i) quiescent dense, unbudded virgin daughter cells, which are able to synchronously reproduce, and (ii) less dense, heter-ogeneous (budded/unbudded, mother/daughter) non-quiescent cells which lose the ability to repro-duce. Further, the quiescent population contained significantly more glycogen and markedly higher viability during 28 days storage.

Population heterogeneity and genetic instability
Whilst the direct relevance of the quiescence story is not clear, it is a further reminder of the heteroge-neity of microbial populations. This has not always been recognized. On reflection, the vast majority of studies of yeast physiology and metabolism in the brewing world have been performed at a ‘bulk’ level yielding an ‘average’ measurement. Indeed, rather than being homogeneous, the dawning realization is that populations of single-strain, pure-culture yeast in fermenter, handling and storage are hetero-geneous. This is a generic microbiological principle, such that microorganisms exhibit cellular individu-ality that ‘even when genetic and environmental differences between cells are reduced as much as possible, single cells differ from each other with respect to gene expression and other phenotypic traits’ (Ackerman, 2015). The bottom line is that heterogeneity of genetically uniform populations

is considered to confer a selective advantage during stress and in response to fluctuating environments.
As a subject, ‘heterogeneity’ has been flagged most notably at the macro scale, where yeast distri-bution in fermenter is heterogeneous, the extent of which varies with time and yeast strain/flocculence (Boulton et al., 2007). Heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as the size of individual yeast cells varies with  chronological  age/bud  scars  (Barker  and Smart, 1996), growth rate (Johnston et al., 1979) and ploidy (Galitski et al., 1999). Better recognition of phenotypic heterogeneity has come through cell sorting and flow cytometry (for a review see Davey and Kell, 1996), which has demonstrated hetero-geneity in brewing yeast for internal pH (Imai and Ohno, 1995). Heterogeneity of cellular glycogen content during fermentation has been shown with ‘individual cell spectroscopy’ (Cahill et al., 2000).
Another  source  of  phenotypic  heterogeneity is genetic instability. This reflects the pressures of adaptive evolution ‘where populations must secure a margin of genome variability that allows for the adjustment  to  new  environmental  conditions’ (Skoneczna et al., 2015). Instability is ‘a given’ occurring via a variety of routes and driven by a number of factors. Whatever their shape, mutations are spontaneous during DNA replication and ‘if a mutation is beneficial in the environment, allow-ing the cell and its descendants to proliferate more rapidly, that lineage will begin to increase in relative abundance in the population’ (Gresham, 2015). As populations evolve, lineages with beneficial muta-tions increase at the expense of cells without such mutations. Less predictably, lineages with greater ‘fitness’ then predominate, winning out and over time dominating the population. The hitherto dif-ficulty in estimating the extent and complexity of spontaneous mutation has underplayed its impor-tance, scale and significance (Zhu et al., 2014).
In brewing, genetic instability has had a some-what chequered history, which has undermined widespread acceptance. However, without (typi-cally) being mentioned explicitly, it is one of the drivers that has led to the management of the number of yeast cycles or generations that are replenished through the yeast supply process. Early sightings of instability stem from a series of publica-tions from Guinness between 1963 and 1996 (for details see Boulton and Quain, 2001) that detailed ‘spontaneous’  changes  in  maltotriose  utilization
78 |  Quain


and  marked  switches  in  flocculence.  Whether this reflects a benefit in terms of fitness or simply process  visibility  and  detection  is  not  clear.  A landmark paper (Casey, 1996), using the then new technique of karyotyping reported changes in the fingerprints of production lager yeast sampled and stored between 1958 and 1985. More specifically, two  publications  from  different  Japanese  brew-ers reported the detection of flocculence changes during serial repitching in production (Jibiki et al., 2001; Sato et al., 2001). Another report (Quain, 2006a) detailed the tortuous journey from the observation of cropped yeast with enhanced floc-culence, demonstration of genetic change through DNA  fingerprinting,  the  isolation  of  seemingly the same genetic variant some 7 years later and in a brewery more than 400km away, and culminat-ing in the demonstration that both variants (of the same strain) carried an additional copy of chro-mosome VII (Table 3.6). Conversely, Powell and Diacetis (2007) – in an extended production-scale study with an ale and lager yeast for, respectively, 98 and 135 generations – showed no genetic changes or changes in fermentation performance.
Chromosomal loss (or addition) is one of a number or routes that are associated with genetic instability in aneuploid and polyploid yeasts. There are different perspectives whether this results in reduced fitness (Storchova, 2014) or ‘large fitness gains’ which ‘accelerate evolutionary adaptation’ (Selmecki  et  al.,  2015).  Although  beyond  the scope of this chapter, it is tempting to build on the anecdotal preponderance of lager strains exhibiting genetic instability as being a consequence of the hybrid genome as well as aneuploidy. Of course this may reflect the relatively young evolutionary ‘age’ of lager yeasts or the enhanced visibility through the

dominance of lager-type beer production volumes over ale.
Less heralded but long recognized as part of the ‘genetic variants’ story is the petite mutation. First identified in France by Ephrussi et al. (1949), and named to reflect the atypically phenotypic small size of colonies on agar plates. Petites are respiratory deficient as a consequence of alterations or part deletion of mitochondrial DNA. Such Rho– or p–  mutants grow more slowly on fermentable sugars and are unable to grow aerobically on non-fermentable carbon sources (e.g. glycerol, ethanol etc.) Mutants without mitochondrial DNA (p0), although rare, have been found in cropped yeast (Lawrence et al., 2013) but are often lethal in cells growing aerobically. Deletion or rearrangement of mitochondrial DNA (p–) impacts on the genes for transfer and ribosomal RNAs, thus blocking the synthesis  of  proteins  in  mitochondria.  Further, the mitochondria contribute to the biosynthesis of haem, amino acids, nucleotides and fatty acid metabolism.
Generically, the petite mutation is considered to be ‘spontaneous’ and ‘natural’ and is present in brewery fermentations at a frequency of ca. 0.1–1 to 6% or more (Šilhánková et al., 1970; Smart, 2007; Lawrence et al., 2013) of the yeast cell population. Strain susceptibility is (as always) a variable that is associated with many and various causes, includ-ing ‘stress’ (e.g. oxidative), cone storage and serial repitching (Lawrence et al., 2013). The frequency of petites is estimated ‘to be 106–108 times more frequent than other mutational types’ (Šilhánková et al., 1970).
In passing, another spontaneous (and stable) mutation of brewing yeasts results in glycogen defi-ciency at a frequency of ≤0.8%. Growth of these

mutants was linked with elevated levels of petites (2–9%) (Chester, 1967) and conversely analysis of ‘normal’ petites were found to have ‘appreciably less glycogen than those of wild-type yeast (Chester, 1968).
Whatever the spontaneous mutation, it is salu-tary to reflect that a frequency of 1%, pitching yeast at 15×106/ml contains a substantial petite popula-tion of 1.5×105/ml. Whilst rare, there are reports that the frequency of petites can be much higher. For example, reported issues in multisite brand matching were associated with a brewery where ca 4% of yeast harvested from fermenters and up to 50% of stored yeast was respiratory deficient (Mor-rison and Suggett, 1983). Beers from the problem brewery were characterized by elevated diacetyl and reduced levels of esters together with reduced yeast viability. The issue was seemingly associated with protracted yeast storage (4–7 days at 4°C) that, when replaced with 24 hours at 4°C, reduced the occurrence of petites to 1% or less. Whilst an extreme and somewhat surprising demonstration from some 40 years ago – which sadly received no subsequent elaboration – petites remain a concern during brewery yeast processing.
Today the generic threat of petites are argu-ably a greater concern, as they are much less likely to  be  detected  through  testing  or  established through  problem-solving  or  root-cause  analysis. This sad state of affairs reflects reduced technical resources, a diluted knowledge base and a lack of appreciation of what is a relatively niche element of brewery yeast performance. Indeed, our under-standing of petites in brewery fermentations and handling is something of a ‘grey’ area as – under anaerobic, catabolite-repressed conditions – res-piratory capability is not possible and the organelle is cytologically underdeveloped (and often termed ‘promitochondria’). However, despite this, petites with  compromised  mitochondrial  function  and performance are not fit for purpose. This is intrigu-ing and is counter to the aforementioned selection of genetic variants in terms of enhanced fitness.
As with chromosomal instability, new insights from applied yeast genomics pose new questions as to the formation of petites in the two distinct lineages  of  S.  pastorianus.  These  investigations build on the observation that the Group II ‘strain generated a lower amount of respiratory deficient ‘petite’ cells’ (Walther et al., 2014). Further, with

the mitochondria of lager yeast being derived from the S. eubayanus parent (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008) – and not S. cerevisiae – there is a case for a funda-mental difference in frequency of petite mutations in ale and lager yeasts.

Best practice
It  is  thought-provoking  that  ‘best  practice’  for brewery yeast storage is based on a combination of common sense and practical good design. Of course, as with all aspects of yeast handling and management, hygienic design of vessels and mains together with effective clean-in-place procedures is a given. More specifically in terms of yeast storage and minimizing damage, key parameters include storage	temperature	(2–4°C),	homogeneity through ‘gentle’ mixing of yeast, time (ideally <2 days but no more than 4 days) and yeast solids at ca 40%. Ideally, there are two further considerations that ‘add value’. As noted above, barm ale abv has an overarching impact on yeast viability during storage and ideally should be reduced with sterile water to <5%. Further, there is benefit in avoiding any exposure to air/oxygen by the application of an inert headspace gas to the storage vessel.

Consequences of failure
As  a  process,  yeast  storage  is  assured  through control of temperature and management of time. Should either of these parameters drift or hygienic practices fail, then yeast in storage vessel will be compromised in viability or microbial contamina-tion. In such an event, the yeast would probably go forward without notice and any subsequent issues of fermentation performance or beer quality would possibly be flagged after the event. It is noteworthy that where viability has been compromised, tradi-tional yeast viability measurement prior to pitching adds value in flagging deterioration. Conversely, automated pitching systems that pitch on viable cell number would correct for reduced viability and pitch more yeast biomass to achieve the desired pitching rate. However, in doing so, more dead yeast would be pitched, to the detriment of beer quality.

Abstract
The taxonomy and systematics of brewing yeasts have  been  a  matter  of  debate  and  controversy since the early days of microbiology in the 1800s, when Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis were first cultivated. The turbulent history of beer yeast systematics epitomizes the endeavours of yeast taxonomy since its origins when researchers used morphological characters and physiological traits to distinguish and classify species. The molecular revolution initiated in the 1980s exposed limitations of phenotypic methods, revealing numerous species synonyms and misclas-sifications. Today, DNA sequence data provide the means for accurate species identifications, strain typing, and phylogenetic classifications. Progress in the scientific knowledge of beer yeasts was also delayed  by  another  level  of  complexity,  which included inter-species hybridizations occurring in the brewing environment. Inter-species hybridiza-tions created a plethora of chimeric genomes that could only be completely resolved when genomics entered the scene in the last two decades. Indeed, many key beer genotypes like S. pastorianus, the lager yeast, and S. bayanus, a beer contaminant, are complex multi-Saccharomyces species hybrids whose life history and ancestry are only now being


revealed. Recently, a combination of novel genome sequencing approaches and microbial ecology stud-ies solved decades-long disputes and revealed the wild genetic stocks of domesticated beer lineages. Here, we give an historical perspective of brewer’s yeast taxonomy including also non-Saccharomyces yeast species and review available phenotypic and genetic-based typing methods for species and strain discrimination.


Introduction
Yeasts together with malt, water, and hops are an essential ingredient for beer. Their primary role is to convert sugars extracted from cereals into etha-nol and carbon dioxide. Myriad other products of yeast metabolism are also essential for the unique sensorial characteristics that contribute to the final product. Studies on the history of beer and brewing have traced the ancestor of modern beers to cereal-based beverages produced in Ancient Egypt and in Mesopotamia circa 6,000 BC (Hornsey, 2003; McGovern, 2009). It is likely that the microorgan-isms that fermented those primeval beers were not radically different from those that we use today. For example, yeast cells were detected in Egyptian leav-ened bread dough dated 3.000 BC (Samuel, 1996;
86 |  Sampaio et al.


2000) and molecular evidence for the presence of S. cerevisiae in wine fermentation has been obtained from pottery jars of the same period (Cavalieri et al., 2003).
The most relevant microorganisms for brewing are by far yeasts of the genus Saccharomyces. This genus includes also the yeast species that are essen-tial for all the other processes that involve alcoholic fermentation. The best examples of such products are bread, wine and sake, but many other foods and beverages with a more local range of production and consumption, like palm wine or sorghum beer (Tapsoba et al., 2015), also rely on yeasts of the genus Saccharomyces.
Yeasts form a heterogeneous and artificial group of fungi that live predominantly in the unicellular stage and, similarly to other groups of microorgan-isms, lack distinct morphological traits (Kreger van Rij, 1987). Therefore, contrary to most plants or animals, yeasts are not only normally invisible to the naked eye but, when observed with a micro-scope, lack the distinctive morphological features that could allow the recognition of different species. Invisibility and lack of distinguishable micro-mor-phologies  or  other  stable  and  phylogenetically coherent phenotypic markers, such as species-spe-cific physiological properties, condemned yeasts, and microbes in general, to an unstable taxonomy. This contributed to consolidate, especially among the non-specialists, the belief that the recognition of the relevant yeasts for brewing was a daunting task, shadowed by disputed and conflicting taxonomic criteria and obscure nomenclature rules. In the period of more than 150 years from the first scien-tific records of yeasts by Cagniard-Latour, Kützing and Schwann in the 1830s (Barnett, 2004) to the generalization of DNA sequence data for taxonomy in  the  1990s,  a  combination  of  methodologies that did not have the power to clearly differenti-ate species was employed in successive attempts at understanding yeast diversity and the species and lineages underlying it. Different approaches and different philosophies lead to frequent name changes that, for the most part, confounded those in industry or other applied fields that required at best a stable and logical nomenclature system. The age of enlightenment for microbial taxonomy was initiated when molecular sequence data were used to recognize species and to infer phylogenetic

relationships,   first   for   bacteria   and   archaea (Woese and Fox, 1977) and then for microscopic eukaryotes, with fungi being among the first to be investigated (e.g. Walker and Doolittle, 1982).


Yeasts – significance and relevance
Yeasts represent an artificial group because the predominant or exclusive unicellular stage arose by convergent evolution in distinct and not directly related evolutionary lineages of fungi. As a conse-quence, the filamentous growth mode is reduced or absent and cell division takes place normally by budding, although other processes can also occur, e.g. fission or the formation of forcibly discharged propagules at the end of sterigmata. Based on the available molecular phylogenetic evidence, it can be inferred that the yeast stage evolved multiple times in the two main lineages of fungi, the phyla Asco-mycota and Basidiomycota (Taylor et al., 2004).
The scientific understanding of the relevance of yeasts started with Pasteur (1866, 1876), who dem-onstrated that living cells (yeasts) were responsible for the alcoholic fermentation in wine and beer. Another aspect of major importance in those early days was the development of the procedures for the cultivation of yeasts as pure cultures by Hansen. Since yeast cultures could be easily obtained from wine or beer and were amenable to propagation and manipulation in the laboratory, Saccharomyces, notably the beer and wine yeasts, played a central role in the early studies of biochemistry, microbiol-ogy, cell biology and genetics. It is therefore natural that S. cerevisiae became the first model eukaryotic organism, being also the first eukaryote to have the full extent of its genome sequence determined (Goffeau et al., 1996).


Yeast taxonomy
Yeast taxonomy arose with the pioneering works of Meyen, who created the name Saccharomyces in 1838, and Kützing, who in 1833 had given rise to Cryptococcus, although some of the species he described  were  in  fact  algae.  Subsequent  mile-stones were the recognition of the sexual features of the ascomycetes in some yeasts, by Schwann and  Reess;  the  discovery  of  the  fission  yeast

Schizosaccharomyces by Lindner in 1893; and of conjugating yeasts described as Zygosaccharomyces by Baker in 1901 (reviewed in Barnett, 2004). Guil-liermond published the first treatise on yeasts in 1912, followed in 1928 by a dichotomous key for yeast identification that included 22 genera. The genus Candida, which included clinically relevant asexual yeasts, was created in 1923 by Berkhout, and Harrison created in 1927 the genus Rhodotorula for yeasts that formed pink to red colonies. Starting in 1931, a series of monographs was published by Dutch researchers: Stelling-Dekker (1931), Lodder (1934), Diddens and Lodder (1942), Lodder and Kreger van Rij (1952), Lodder (1970) and Kreger-van Rij (1984). This series contributed to unifying the taxonomic study of yeasts and the publications of 1952, 1970, and 1984 constituted the first three editions of the most comprehensive monograph on yeasts, The Yeasts: a Taxonomic Study. The last two editions of this monograph were published in 1998 and 2011. Whereas the first edition included 180 species, subsequent editions incorporated an increasing number of species and genera so that the fifth edition listed nearly 1500 species.
The taxonomic criteria used to study yeasts changed over the years in tandem with our under-standing of their biology and with the availability of new methodologies for scientific inquiry. In the early days, a strong emphasis was given to mor-phology. The shape of vegetative cells and mode of cell division, formation of pseudomycelium or of mycelium in certain media, and details of the sexual stage were considered key criteria for species and genus recognition. The study of the sexual stage evaluated the presence or absence of cell-to-cell conjugation prior to ascospore (meiospore) forma-tion, the number and shape of ascospores, and the persistence or dehiscence of the ascus, the cell that contained the ascospores. Another line of taxo-nomic criteria that were gradually implemented in yeast taxonomy consisted of comparing physiologi-cal and biochemical properties of cultures. This approach, aimed at distinguishing species based on their physiological profiles, was obviously related to the applied concerns of researchers working close to the brewing and wine industries. In fact, yeast taxonomy has an applied origin, with strong con-nections to the fermentation industries of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Logically,

the first tests consisted of determining which sugars could be fermented. As the number of known yeast species expanded, so the number of physiological tests had to be increased. In 1928, Guilliermond’s scheme included testing for the fermentation of glu-cose, mannose, fructose, galactose, sucrose, lactose, and inulin, with Stelling-Dekker adding maltose and rafinose in 1931. In 1934, Lodder tested also the ability of each yeast to grow aerobically on sugars as sole carbon sources. In 1951, Wickerham used chemically defined media for obtaining the profiles of utilization of different sources of carbon and  nitrogen  (Wickerham,  1951),  creating  the standards  for  yeast  identification:  the  ‘nitrogen base’ and ‘carbon base’ media. These formulations were so successful that they have been produced commercially ever since. Unfortunately, all these types of taxonomic criteria had a major weakness. The simple ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ results given by of many of these phenotypic characters and their rapid evolution could give rise to homoplasies, i.e. to similarity not caused by a common evolutionary history, thus introducing erroneous assessments in taxonomic schemes.
Starting  in  the  1960s,  new  methods  were applied in yeast taxonomy in order to complement the macro- and micro-morphological criteria and physiological data. Electron microscopy was used to  study  yeast  cytology  and  addressed  details of  the  septal  pore  or  ascospore  ornamentation among other aspects of ultrastructure (Barnett and Robinow, 2002). The 1980s witnessed the gradual implementation  of  molecular  methods  aiming at  analysing  nucleotide  sequences.  DNA–DNA reassociation studies were used to test conspecific relationships among phenotypically similar strains (Kurtzman,  1987).  Chemotaxonomy  played  a role in genus-level analyses, for example with the determination and comparison of the number of Coenzyme Q isoprene units (Yamada et al., 1987) and for assessment of more distant relationships with the analyses of major cell-wall carbohydrates (Prillinger et al., 1993).
However, none of these advances compares with the revolution caused by the use of DNA sequence data for yeast identification and for inferring phy-logenetic relationships among species or genera. A first necessary step was the determination and archiving of sequence data from the type strains

of known yeast species. This was achieved in the late 1990s for ascomycetous yeasts (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998) and 2 years later for basidiomycet-ous yeasts (Fell et al., 2000). The sequence most amenable was the variable D1/D2 domain of large subunit (26S) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Avail-ability of sequence data for the entire spectrum of yeast species fuelled a major advance in yeast tax-onomy. In spite of notable exceptions, a pattern of sequence uniformity among strains of a given spe-cies as well as sequence divergence among different species paved the way for the molecular identifica-tion of yeasts. As a consequence, the phenotypic criteria  that  were  at  the  base  of  identification schemes, employing traditional dichotomous keys or computer-assisted approaches (Barnett et al., 2000), were relegated to a secondary and mostly complementary role in species identifications and also in descriptions of new species. Sequence data provided species-specific DNA barcodes and was easily archived in public databases from which it could be searched and retrieved through the increasingly generalized use of the worldwide web. Finally, and contrary to most of the previously developed chemotaxonomic or molecular meth-ods, the protocols for obtaining DNA sequence data  were  relatively  simple  to  implement  and were not dependent on particular local laboratory optimizations. At last, one taxonomic criterion pro-vided data that could be universally interchanged among laboratories and could feed global databases like DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan), GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) and EMBL-ENA (European Molecular Biol-ogy Laboratory European Nucleotide Archive). As the availability of sequencing facilities increased, the methods for analysing sequence data became easier  to  implement.  Since  sequence  analyses encompassed more objective criteria for the rec-ognition of species boundaries than the previous phenotype-based methods, the number of yeast species descriptions increased dramatically from 500 species in 1984, the beginning of the sequenc-ing era, to 1500 species, that are included in the latest edition of ‘The Yeasts’ monograph published in  2011  (Kurtzman  et  al.,  2011).  Although  in some cases sequence data provided arguments for merging species that were originally defined based on phenotypic criteria, the reverse situation, i.e.

the detection of cryptic species only (or mostly) recognizable based on sequence data, was much more frequent. Another major advantage of the generalization of sequence data to support yeast classification schemes was the gradual abolishment of the dichotomy between sexual (teleomorphic) and asexual (anamorphic) yeast species. The dual nomenclature system, one for sexual taxa and the other for asexual ones, that had been in place since the beginning of yeast taxonomy, could be merged into a unified one, a change that had to await the necessary alterations on the Code for Nomencla-ture of Plants Algae and Fungi (Hawksworth, 2011; McNeill and Turland, 2011; McNeill et al., 2011) and that is currently being implemented for yeasts (e.g. Kurtzman and Robnett, 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). This opened the possibility of reducing the complexity of fungal nomenclature by classifying sexual and asexual yeast stages in the same genus. Another important aspect of the new Code was that no longer did names of sexual genera have priority over names of asexual genera. There-fore, the name to be retained could be the oldest name, according to the traditional rules of nomen-clature, or a more recent one if other aspects such as, for example, the frequency of name usage were considered to be more relevant (Kurtzman, 2015).
The limitations of single-gene analyses to infer more distant phylogenetic relationships were made evident with the accumulation of studies of differ-ent fungal groups. As a consequence, multigene phylogenies have become prevalent. In recent years, yeast genomics, i.e. the use of whole genome data for the investigation of evolutionary, developmental, and functional questions, has gained momentum. For many yeast species, complete genome data has been obtained with next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches, which allows a deeper level of scrutiny on the evolution of individual species and of lineages encompassing species with different levels of phylogenetic relatedness (Liu et al., 2009). For example, cases of horizontal gene transfer or of interspecies hybridization could only be detected with the implementation of comparative genomics, functional genomics and phylogenomics (Coelho et al., 2013). Moreover, the prospect of having whole-genome sequences for all described yeast species appears feasible in the next few years (e.g. Hittinger et al., 2015).

Taxonomy of the genus Saccharomyces
As mentioned in the previous section, the creation of the genus Saccharomyces dates back to the begin-ning of yeast taxonomy. The changes that it endured epitomize the turbulent history of yeast taxonomy. Reess (1870) provided the first comprehensive diagnosis of the genus that emphasized multipolar budding, asci with one to four ascospores, and absence  of  mycelium.  While  Meyen  described three species in 1838, S. cerevisiae for beer strains, S. pomorum for cider strains, and S. vini for wine strains, Reess (1870) recognized two species, the beer yeast S. cerevisiae and S. ellipsoideus, which fermented  fruit  juices.  Later,  Hansen  (1908) retained S. cerevisiae for top-fermenting (ale) beer yeasts and described S. carlsbergensis for bottom-fermenting  (lager)  beer  yeasts.  Stelling-Dekker (1931) accepted 23 species in the genus, collapsing Zygosaccharomyces into Saccharomyces. Moreover, S. ellipsoideus was considered to represent a variety of S. cerevisiae due to the absence of relevant differences between them. The tendency to enlarge the genus Saccharomyes continued in subsequent years and in 1952, in the first edition of The Yeasts: a Taxonomic Study, Lodder and Kreger-van Rij (1952) incor-porated species of Torulaspora and Debaryomyces while merging several of the existing Saccharomyces species. After these changes, the genus contained 30 species. In the second edition of The Yeasts monograph, van der Walt (1970) accepted 41 spe-cies in Saccharomyces. He also merged some species and S. carlsbergensis was included in S. uvarum. van der Walt referred to this broad circumscrip-tion of the genus Saccharomyces, which included species previously and/or afterwards classified in Zygosaccharomyces, Torulaspora, and Debaryomyces, as Saccharomyces sensu lato (van der Walt 1970). Within the genus, the species closely related to the type species (S. cerevisiae) constituted the so-called Saccharomyces sensu stricto. At that time notable members of the sensu stricto group were S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, and S. uvarum.
The next chapter of the history of Saccharomy-ces witnesses the arrival of the first generation of DNA-based methods: the determinations of base composition  of  nuclear  DNA  and  DNA–DNA reassociation assays. Yarrow and Nakase (1975) compared the GC content of the DNA of spe-cies  classified  in  Saccharomyces  and  confirmed

the four groups previously established by van der Walt (1970). Moreover, because of the narrow range of the GC content of the species of the sensu stricto group, they defended that they represented ‘populations or physiological variants of a single species, S. cerevisiae’. Along the same lines, results that were obtained with DNA–DNA reassociation assays  suggested  several  Saccharomyces  species were conspecific (Rosini et al., 1982). For example, S. chevalieri and S. italicus were considered to be equivalent to S. cerevisiae. Therefore in the third edi-tion of The Yeasts, Yarrow (1984) considered that S. cerevisiae was undistinguishable from 17 other species, including S. bayanus, S. carlsbergensis, and S. uvarum. As a result, the entire sensu stricto group was merged into S. cerevisiae and the genus was reduced to seven species.
However,   DNA–DNA   reassociation   stud-ies published shortly after the radical reduction of Saccharomyces sensu stricto to a single species told a different story. DNA–DNA reassociation values between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus were low, thus suggesting two separate species (Martini and Kurtzman, 1985). Moreover, S. carlsbergensis showed intermediate relatedness with both S. cer-evisiae and S. bayanus. This and the higher genome size of S. carlsbergensis led Martini and Kurtzman (1985) to hypothesize that it was an amphidiploid hybrid between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. Martini and Martini (1987) confirmed these results using a larger set of strains. They also replaced the name S. carlsbergensis with S. pastorianus for reasons of nomenclatural priority since Hansen had described S.  pastorianus  in  1904  and  S.  carlsbergensis  in 1908. By the end of the 1980s, S. paradoxus was resurrected from synonymy with S. cerevisiae after passing the test of DNA–DNA reassociation (Mar-tini, 1989). Therefore, four species (S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S. pastorianus and S. paradoxus) had been confirmed by the latest techniques available at the time to comprise Saccharomyces, i.e. to the sensu stricto group. In the fourth edition of ‘The Yeasts’, Vaughan-Martini and Martini (1998) considered a total of 14 species in Saccharomyces, an expansion from the previous edition but that did not affect the sensu stricto group. In subsequent years, the use of molecular sequence data confirmed that these four species were well separated from the other members of the genus (James et al., 1997; Kurtz-man and Robnett, 1998), thus supporting the view
90 |  Sampaio et al.


that the genus Saccharomyces should be restricted to  the  sensu  stricto  species.  This  monophyletic group was enlarged by Naumov et al. (2000) who described, based on molecular sequence data from strains originally deposited in culture collections in Brazil and Japan, S. cariocanus, S. kudriavzevii, and S. mikatae. One of these species (S. cariocanus) is currently viewed as representing one of the main populations of S. paradoxus and is therefore is not recognized as a separate species. A comprehensive multigene phylogenetic analysis of several genera of ascomycetous yeasts more related to Saccharo-myces was performed by Kurtzman and Robnett (2003) showing once more the monophylly of the sensu stricto group and justifying the assignment of the species classified in the sensu lato group to the new genera Kazachstania, Naumovia and Lachancea (Kurtzman, 2003). Therefore, 165 years after its birth, the genus Saccharomyces appeared to have found stable waters after being rescued from its turbulent past by the awesome power of molecular phylogenetics. However, as a probable reminiscence of the trauma of those times of unrest, many researchers seem to ignore that Saccharomyces has a well-defined phylogenetic circumscription and still prefer to use the outdated sensu stricto label (Replansky et al., 2008) or to overlook the genera that now accommodate the species previously clas-sified in the sensu lato group (e.g. Roop et al., 2016). The genus received a new species in 2008 when researchers  in  China  isolated  strains  associated with oak trees that they named S. arboricola (Wang and Bai, 2008). Therefore, in the fifth and latest edition of The Yeasts, Vaughan-Martini and Martini (2011) adopted the phylogenetic circumscription proposed in 2003 and recognized eight species in the genus (S. arboricola, S. bayanus, S. cariocanus, S. cerevisiae, S. kudriavzevii, S. mikatae, S. paradoxus and S. pastorianus). A point of much debate was the status of S. uvarum. High DNA–DNA reasso-ciation values between the type strains of the two species (Rosini et al., 1982) led Naumov (1996) to recommend that S. uvarum should be considered a synonym of S. bayanus. Later, Naumov (2000) and Naumova et al. (2005) observed that hybrids between the two type strains had intermediate fertility (27–37%) and recognized two varieties, S. bayanus var. bayanus and S. bayanus var. uvarum (Naumov, 2000). Emphasizing earlier DNA–DNA reassociation results and disregarding more recent

arguments indicating that S. uvarum represented a species distinct from S. bayanus (e.g. Pulvirenti et al., 2000; Nguyen and Gaillardin, 2005), Vaughan-Martini and Martini (2011) maintained S. uvarum as a synonym of S. bayanus. Libkind et al. (2011) detected sympatric Saccharomyces populations in Nothofagus (Southern beech) forests in Patagonia and characterized them using whole-genome data. One of the populations was identified as S. uvarum, which was definitively shown to be distinct from S. bayanus. The second population represented an undescribed species that was designated S. eubay-anus. This name means the ‘true S. bayanus’ and refers to the complex genome of S. bayanus, shown by Libkind et al. (2011) to be a triple hybrid (see also section below for more discussion of S. eubay-anus and S. bayanus).
In conclusion, and as summarized in Fig. 4.1, presently the genus includes seven natural species (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudri-avzevii, S. arboricola, S. eubayanus and S. uvarum), together  with  two  artificial  and  hybrid  species exclusively associated with human-made fermenta-tive environments (S. pastorianus and S. bayanus).


Brewing yeasts
In the previous section, we briefly illustrated the taxonomic changes associated with the genus Sac-charomyces during its approximate one and a half centuries of existence. A direct consequence of those changes was the modification, multiple times, of the names and concepts of species. This has made the subject of understanding the circumscription of the different species, their most relevant differ-ences,  and  their  participation  in  human-driven fermentations particularly complex, even for those more familiar with the topic. Saccharomyces species names and corresponding species concepts are very dependent on the scientific context of a particular period and have to be viewed and discussed in light of their historical background. In many cases, new data promoted a change of the classification crite-ria and an almost inevitable consequence was the change of the nomenclature. In the next sections we discuss the relevance for brewing of various Saccharomyces species, using the most up-to-date circumscription of each species. In Table 4.1 we list the most relevant Saccharomyces species for brewing, including old species names not currently

Saccharomyces cerevisiae
S. cerevisiae, the flagship species of the genus, is the  most  industrially  exploited  microorganism. Strains of this species are used for the production of industrial ethanol and in the fermentation of alcoholic beverages, including top-fermented beer, wine, sake, and distilled spirits. This species is also used for bread dough leavening and probably is the species used in most cases of yeast fermentation of artisanal foods and beverages in Africa (Jespersen, 2003; Ludlow et al., 2016), Asia (Pathania et al., 2010; Shrestha et al., 2002) and America (Vallejo et al., 2013; Ludlow et al., 2016).
Because S. cerevisiae dominates many sponta-neous fermentations but is rarely found in more natural systems such as vineyards, the view that it represents a purely domesticated species that is  exclusively  associated  with  man-driven  fer-mentations was defended by Martini (1993) and Vaughan-Martini and Martini (1995) and received generalized acceptance (e.g. Boulton and Quain, 2001). In the view of many researchers, S. cerevisiae did not occur in natural habitats and was considered to be associated with wineries and their equipment. This perspective was challenged by the finding of

S. cerevisiae in wild habitats. The most consistent studies relied on two key aspects: the use of an enrichment medium with ethanol, thus favouring the growth of ethanol-resistant yeasts such as those of the genus Saccharomyces; and the sampling of oak trees (Quercus spp., family Fagaceae), namely bark and soil underneath the trees. In the last two dec-ades, laborious field-work studies have revealed that S. cerevisiae has a natural distribution in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (e.g. Sniegowski et al., 2002; Sampaio and Gonçalves, 2008; Wang et al., 2012), being therefore not limited to artificial environments created or modified by humans like wineries, vineyards, or grapes. More recently, the same approach was used to investigate the natural distribution of S. cerevisiae in a tropical region, not colonized by oaks, and new populations and a new candidate tree-habitat were uncovered (Barbosa et al., 2016). The finding of these wild populations has shown that the natural history of S. cerevisiae goes far beyond its association with humans.
The degradation of glucose to ethanol without
the complete oxidation to CO2, even when oxygen
is present, results in the build-up of toxic ethanol levels, an ecological strategy that enables S. cer-evisiae to outcompete other species (Piskur et al., 2006). Although other yeasts are also capable of fermenting sugars to ethanol and CO2, the vast

wealth of knowledge that has been gathered on S. cerevisiae sugar metabolism has revealed a combina-tion of several properties that together give rise to a unique phenotype. These include a fast growth rate under a fermentation regime; eficient repression by glucose of respiration, thus promoting fermen-tation  and  ethanol  production;  good  ability  to produce ethanol; tolerance to the resulting environ-mental stresses, such as high ethanol concentration and low oxygen levels; and, most importantly, a fine-tuned regulatory network that optimizes the strategy of sugar utilization and ethanol formation

through the different fermentation stages (Ihmels et al., 2005). Therefore, the confirmed association of wild populations of S. cerevisiae with oaks hints at a natural ecology not entirely dominated by the colonization of sugar-rich substrates. In fact tree bark and soils are typically nutrient-poor environ-ments and support small populations. Together, these new findings challenge the traditional con-cept of S. cerevisiae as a yeast exclusively associated with sugar-rich substrates and suggest that we are far from understanding its life cycle in nature. Rec-onciling the new evidence with the fundamental

physiological characteristics of S. cerevisiae is the task that lies ahead.
If the natural ecology of S. cerevisiae remains, for the most part, a mystery, the population structure of this species is also far from being understood. Using multilocus sequencing, Fay and Benavides (2005) showed that S. cerevisiae included both wild and domesticated strains and suggested two independent domestication events, one for wine and the other for sake. They also demonstrated that domesticated strains derive from wild relatives and not the opposite. Population genomics is allowing researchers to disentangle the relationships among wild  populations  of  S.  cerevisiae  and  putatively domesticated groups. Liti et al. (2009) revealed a complex population structure composed of 5 genetically clean lineages. Two of them represented domesticated groups and corresponded to wine and sake yeasts. Another two populations were natural (wild) and consisted of an oak-associated North American population and a mostly clonal Malay-sian population associated with inflorescences of Bertram palms. A fifth population was found in West African artisanal fermented beverages and it is not yet clear if it represents a wild or domesticated population. Another important finding was that many strains were genetically admixed and had contributions from two or more groups, probably because of outcrossing involving ancestors from different populations. A recent study expanded this analysis and included S. cerevisiae strains isolated as opportunistic pathogens in humans, most of which had mosaic recombinant genomes (Strope et al., 2015). Very likely the entire sequence space of S. cerevisiae remains unknown and new wild and domesticated populations will be revealed in the future. For example, divergent populations from primary forests in China have been reported (Wang et al., 2012) and, although the full extent of their genome sequence has not yet been analysed, it is likely that they represent additional wild popula-tions. In addition, Almeida et al. (2015) showed that an oak-associated population in southern Europe was markedly distinct from similar populations in North America and Japan, thus representing a distinct wild lineage. Moreover, this Mediterranean population was identified as the closest wild relative of domesticated wine yeasts (Almeida et al., 2015). Whereas the genetic diversity and domestica-tion signatures of wine yeasts has been explored,

even if incompletely (Marsit and Dequin, 2015), comparatively much less is known for S. cerevisiae beer yeasts. Traditionally, two kinds of brewing yeasts have been recognized – ale and lager yeasts, the top-fermenting and bottom-fermenting yeasts, respectively. Presently, it is evident that only ale yeasts  belong  to  S.  cerevisiae  since  lager  yeasts belong to S. pastorianus (see below). Classically, these two yeast groups were distinguished based on the ability to ferment the disaccharide melibiose. Ale yeasts, contrary to lager yeasts, did not ferment melibiose. Whereas the genetics and the genomes of lager yeasts have been intensively studied, top-fermenting ale-type yeasts have only recently been investigated with population genomics tools. Casey (1990, 1996) analysed ale and lager strains with Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis in order to gener-ate chromosome fingerprints and reported a higher diversity for ale yeasts, which was hypothesized to be a consequence of the multiple locations of origin  of  top-fermenting  yeasts,  with  breweries in different regions selecting unique yeast strains for each location. A genotyping study employ-ing microsatellite markers and a large collection of industrial S. cerevisiae strains revealed distinct genotypes  organized  according  to  their  usage, i.e. bread, beer, wine, and sake. Although wine strains were much more numerous than any other group, this study provided the first indication that wine and ale beer strains were genetically distinct, at least at neutral markers (Legras et al., 2007). Borneman et al. (2011) analysed the genomes of two ale yeast strains, FostersB and FostersO. They observed a much higher level of heterozygosity in the two ale strains than in four wine strains, which was attributed to a ploidy level higher than 2n for beer strains, whereas wine strains were either hap-loid or diploid. Moreover, a considerable genetic distance  was  detected  between  brewing  strains and other industrially relevant strains, such as wine strains and those used for bioethanol production. This remained the first clear indication that top-fermenting brewing strains appeared distinct, at the genome level, from other strains of S. cerevisiae until Gallone et al. (2016) and Gonçalves et al. (2016) investigated a comprehensive collection of top-fermenting beer strains. These studies revealed that ale-type beer yeasts are fundamentally distinct from other industrially relevant strains and much more genetically  diverse  than  wine  yeasts.  Moreover,

beer yeasts have a high incidence of polyploidy and aneuploidy and, probably as a consequence of this, a low or null sporulation ability. The phylogeny pre-sented in Fig. 4.2 combines genome sequences of Gallone et al. (2016) and Gonçalves et al. (2016). Besides a main cluster of beer yeasts related with various  types  of  German,  British,  Belgian  and American beers, beer strains were also found to cluster in the wine, bread and sake clades and in an independent clade sister to the wine clade. Large-scale phenotyping showed industry-specific traits and genome analyses revealed domestication signa-tures of brewing yeasts. For example, a three-gene cluster that included RTM1, a subtelomeric gene associated with sucrose utilization that provides resistance to the inhibitory compounds present in molasses (Borneman et al., 2011), was prevalent in the strains of the main beer clade but not in wine strains (Gonçalves et al., 2016). Moreover, beer yeasts show a significant higher capacity to metabo-lize maltotriose, and abundant substrate in beer wort (Gallone et al., 2016). Another characteristic that appears to have been selected during brewing yeast domestication is the low or null production of  undesirable  volatile  compounds  designated as ‘phenolic off flavours’ (POF) (Thurston et al., 1981). These compounds, exemplified by 4-vinyl guaiacol, are formed when ferulic or other pheny-lacrylic acids are decarboxylated through enzymes encoded by two paralogous genes, FDC1 (ferulic acid decarboxylase) and PAD1 (phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase) (Mukai et al., 2010). Mukai et al. (2014) showed that in most ale strains these genes contained inactivating mutations and consequently functional proteins could not be produced, which prevented  POF  formation.  Genomic  analyses showed that different lineages have acquired dis-tinct inactivating mutations hinting at convergent evolution  during  domestication  (Gallone  et  al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016). However, for some beer styles, such as the Bavarian wheat beers and some Belgian beers, POFs are desired flavour com-ponents since they impart a characteristic clove-like flavour due to the desired decarboxylation of ferulic or cinnamic acids (Dufour et al., 2003; Schneider-banger et al., 2013; Hutzler et al., 2015). Richard et al. (2015) demonstrated that the overexpression of both genes resulted in a significant increase of the synthesis of phenolic compounds. S. cerevisiae strains that ferment these beer types have PAD1 and

FDC1 functional, similarly to what was observed in other industrial variants like wine yeasts, as well as wild strains (Gonçalves et al., 2016).

Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis
As  indicated  in  the  previous  section,  the  two main types of beers are fermented by two distinct and presently clearly recognizable Saccharomyces groups. Top-fermenting ale-style strains belong to S. cerevisiae and represent the prototypical brewing yeasts,  whereas  bottom-fermenting  lager  yeasts, which are hybrids of two Saccharomyces species, are presently classified as S. pastorianus. In the past, the ability to ferment melibiose was an essential element for the taxonomy of beer yeasts and meli-biase-negative yeasts were classified as S. cerevisiae, whereas melibiase-positive strains were classified as S. carlsbergensis, a name that was for some time considered a synonym of another key melibiose-fermenting species, S. uvarum.
Older  literature  (pre-1987)  refers  to  lager yeasts as S. carlsbergensis instead of S. pastorianus. Although the two names refer to the same group of yeasts, two distinct type strains have to be consid-ered. CBS 1538 is the type strain of S. pastorianus and CBS 1513 is the type strain of S. carlsbergensis. As  explained  above,  the  nomenclatural  change concerned the belated recognition that S. pastori-anus was an older name than S. carlsbergensis. This hybrid species is by far the most relevant brewing yeast, since lager beer accounts for 94% of the world market (Riese and Esslinger, 2009). How-ever, S. pastorianus has never been isolated outside the brewing environment; therefore, it appears to be an exclusively domesticated species. Although the precise origin of lager yeasts is unknown, it is logical to assume that their emergence is inti-mately related with the origin and development of lager-brewing in the fifteenth century in Bavaria (Meussdoerffer, 2009). Although S. pastorianus was described by Hansen in 1904, the hybrid nature of lager yeasts was first hypothesized much later in the 1980s (Nilsson-Tillgren et al., 1981; Martini and Kurtzman, 1985; Martini and Martini, 1987). Additional proof was obtained when two different sets of complete chromosomes were detected in lager yeast (Tamai et al., 1998), thus confirming its alloploid nature. Although one of the progeni-tors of S. pastorianus was readily identified as S.

Figure 4.2 Whole-genome phylogeny of S. cerevisiae showing the diversity of top-fermenting beer strains. Phylogeny of 114 strains, inferred from 174991 SNPs, using the maximum likelihood method as implemented in RAxML with the GTRGAMMA model of sequence evolution and rooted with S. paradoxus. Branch lengths correspond to the expected number of substitutions per site. Support values from bootstrap replicates above 90% are shown. The analysis includes representatives of different types of beer starter cultures and of previously described populations (Wine, Mediterranean Oaks, Sake, Philippines, North American and Japanese oaks, West Africa and Malaysia). The ecology or industrial application of each strain is indicated in colour-coded circles after strain designation. Strains from Gallone et al. (2016) are indicated in green and strains from Gonçalves et al. (2006) are indicated in black. The black designations of beer groups follow Gallone et al. (2016) and those in white follow Gonçalves et al. (2006). Where only finished genome sequences were available, the corresponding error-free Illumina reads were simulated using dwgsim (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/dnaa/).

cerevisiae, the non-cerevisiae progenitor remained contentious until the discovery in 2011 of a new yeast species, S. eubayanus, whose genome is an almost exact genetic match of the non-cerevisiae subgenome of S. pastorianus (Libkind et al., 2011). Until that time, the non-cerevisiae contributor to the genome of S. pastorianus was thought to be S. bayanus (Martini and Kurtzman, 1985; Turakainen et al., 1994; Montrocher et al., 1998; Nakao et al., 2009; Bond, 2009), now known to represent also an artificial and hybrid species only associated with anthropic environments, or S. monacensis (Ped-ersen, 1994; Hansen and Kielland-Brandt, 1994; Kielland-Brandt et al., 1995), presently considered a synonym of S. pastorianus. Given the historical and technological context of the development of lager beer, one would suspect that the S. cerevisiae ancestor would be an ale yeast, a hypothesis that was  validated  with  array-comparative  genomic hybridization data (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008).
Early studies that analysed the diversity of lager yeasts were based on chromosome fingerprints and suggested two groups, here designated I and II, the Carlsberg and Tuborg types, respectively (Casey, 1996). Molecular analyses of transposon distribu-tion also confirmed this division (Liti et al., 2005) and more recent studies have contributed to the elucidation of the composition of these two groups (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008; Gibson et al., 2013; Walther et al., 2014). Group I includes well-known strains from the Carlsberg brewery in Denmark, like CBS 1538, the type strain of S. pastorianus; CBS  1513,  the  type  strain  of  S.  carlsbergensis; and CBS 1503, the type strain of S. monacensis. It includes also strains used to produce the Saaz-type beer, typically brewed in regions now in the Czech Republic. Group II contains strains used to produce the Frohberg-type beer, strains from the Netherlands (Heineken and other breweries), and the most used lager strain in the world, Weihenste-phan TUM 34/70 from Bavaria. These two lineages of lager yeasts suggest distinct geographic distribu-tions, corresponding to different breweries. Group I (Saaz strains) is associated with the Bohemian region in Czech Republic and with the Carlsberg brewery in Denmark, whereas group II (Frohberg strains) is associated with the Netherlands and with the Weihenstephan brewery in Germany. The analysis of the genome sequence of S. carlsbergensis CBS 1513 showed that it is substantially larger than

that of S. cerevisiae (19.5Mb instead of 12 Mb) and is basically triploid, with a diploid S. eubayanus and haploid S. cerevisiae genome content (Walther et al., 2014). The genome content of the best-known rep-resentative of group II, the Weihenstephan strain, is tetraploid, with two diploid S. eubayanus and S. cer-evisiae genomes (Nakao et al., 2009; Walther et al., 2014). This strain has 36 chromosomes, with eight chromosome  translocations  occurring  between the two subgenomes (Nakao et al., 2009). For S. carlsbergensis CBS 1513, 29 chromosomes were detected, together with seven unique translocations between chromosomes of both parental genomes (Walther  et  al.,  2014).  Besides  distinct  genetic compositions, the two lineages of lager yeasts have different flavour and brewing profiles. Saaz strains grow better at low temperatures (10°C), have a rela-tively poor fermentation performance compared with Frohberg strains at 22°C, do not use maltotri-ose, and produce lower amounts of esters (Gibson et al., 2013; Walther et al., 2014). Therefore, while both groups evidence their alloploid hybrid nature by combining the cryotolerant phenotype of S. eubayanus with the good fermentation performance of S. cerevisiae, detectable differences both in cryo-tolerance and in fermentation have been linked to the proportional amount of S. eubayanus DNA retained in their respective genomes. Moreover, the different phenotypes offer an explanation for the dominance of Frohberg strains in modern indus-trial brewing.
Multiple lines of evidence point to two inde-pendent origins of lager yeasts. It appears that the Saaz and Frohberg lineages were generated by at least two distinct hybridization events between very  similar  strains  of  S.  eubayanus  with  more divergent ale strains of S. cerevisiae (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008; Baker et al., 2015; Monerawela et al., 2015). From the strict biological point of view, assigning the rank of species to a hybrid is ques-tionable. In fact, lager yeasts form a heterogeneous assemblage of alloploid hybrids lacking a natural ecological niche, natural populations, and sexual reproduction, contrary to natural Saccharomyces species. However, although modern Saccharomyces taxonomy is strongly rooted on phylogenetics, it should in parallel provide a useful and understand-able system for non-specialists, especially those in the industry. Therefore, even if in the strict sense S. pastorianus does not deserve the rank of species it

is, from the practical view, useful to have a simple descriptor for lager yeasts, given their importance and easily recognizable attributes both in the brew-ery and in the laboratory. Moreover, the recognition of two groups of lager yeasts has led some authors to  propose  to  distinguish  them  taxonomically. Wendland (2014) suggested to use S. pastorianus for the strains of group I (Saaz) and S. carlsbergensis for group II (Frohberg). Following the considera-tions above, the recognition in the nomenclature of the two groups might be adopted, especially if the users of taxonomy, e.g. brewers, feel that this recog-nition is desirable. However, whereas naming group I as S. pastorianus is logical, since the type strain of S. pastorianus belongs to this group, naming group II as S. carlsbergensis is not because the type strain of S. carlsbergensis also belongs to group I. This resolu-tion would go against taxonomic rules and, more importantly, would be a confusing designation. A better description of group II would be, perhaps, ‘S. weihenstephanii’. An alternative solution would be to consider these groups as separate races of S. pastori-anus. Although typically they are not used in yeast nomenclature, races constitute an informal rank in the taxonomic hierarchy equivalent to breeds and cultivars, and one example could be S. pastorianus ‘race Weihenstephan’.

Saccharomyces eubayanus and Saccharomyces bayanus
A yeast isolated by Will in 1891 from turbid beer, in  which  it  caused  a  disagreeable  flavour,  was studied by Bay in 1893 and formally described as S. bayanus by Saccardo in 1895. The original strain was lost and one strain originated from the Institute of Brewing in Tokyo and sent to CBS from the Central Laboratory of the South Manchuria Railway Company (Dairen) in 1927, was adopted as the type strain (Lodder and Kreger-van Rig, 1952). The relationship between S. bayanus and S. uvarum, a contemporary species described in 1898 by Beijerinck, has been contentious and was settled only recently (Libkind et al., 2011). Although as discussed earlier (section ‘Taxonomy of the genus Saccharomyces’), S. uvarum was considered a syno-nym of S. bayanus, evidence from molecular studies (e.g. Nguyen and Gaillardin, 1997; Rainieri et al., 1999) argued for the reinstatement of two inde-pendent species. Whereas S. bayanus encompassed a  small  and  heterogeneous  assemblage  of  beer

contaminants with low frequency of sporulation, S. uvarum included a larger, less variable, and more fertile group of wine and cider yeasts, with the wine isolates originating normally from low-temperature fermentations. A key point to the confusion was the nomenclature of CBS 7001, a S. uvarum strain selected  for  genome  sequencing  (Cliften  et  al., 2001; Kellis et al., 2003) but still nowadays referred to as S. bayanus in the literature and SGD and NCBI databases. The hybrid nature of S. bayanus was anticipated in several publications (e.g. Nguyen and Gaillardin, 2005) and has now been fully demon-strated (Nguyen et al., 2011; Libkind et al., 2011). This species shares with S. pastorianus a preferential occurrence  in  the  brewing  environment  (often as a beer contaminant), the apparent absence of a natural habitat, and a complex genome composi-tion. The hybrid nature of the genome of S. bayanus is even more complex than that of S. pastorianus since, in addition to having contributions from S. eubayanus and S. cerevisiae, it also contains genomic regions from S uvarum. Similarly to S. pastorianus, each strain of S. bayanus has a unique genomic composition. For example, the subgenomes of the type strain, CBS 380, are 67% S. uvarum and 33% S. eubayanus, whereas strain NBRC 1948, considered in the pre-genomic era to represent a pure S. bay-anus line (Rainieri et al., 2006), is 37% S. uvarum and  63%  S.  eubayanus  (Libkind  et  al.,  2011). Although, as referred in the previous section, S. bay-anus has been hypothesized as one of the parents of the interspecies hybridization that gave rise to S. pastorianus, it is now postulated that S. pastorianus may have served as progenitor of the various S. bayanus hybrid strains through additional hybridi-zation events with S. uvarum (Libkind et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2011). In conclusion, S. bayanus is now viewed as an artificial hybrid species whose origin is intimately related with the particular envi-ronmental conditions of the brewing environment. S. eubayanus, the latest addition to the genus, was originally found in South America (Libkind et al., 2011). Five populations have been detected so far in S. eubayanus, two in South America (Peris et al., 2014) and three in Asia, in Tibet, Sichuan, and western China (Bing et al., 2014). This species was also found, albeit infrequently, in Wisconsin (Peris et al., 2014) and New Zealand (Gayevskiy and God-dard, 2016). Interestingly, one population from the Tibetan plateau is apparently the closest relative

of the S. eubayanus portion of S. pastorianus, with 99.8%  sequence  similarity  based  on  multilocus sequencing. For Patagonian S. eubayanus, an equiv-alent comparison using a whole-genome estimate is slightly lower at 99.5% (whole genome sequences are not yet available for Tibetan S. eubayanus). Since natural populations of S. eubayanus have not been detected yet in Europe, it has been suggested that the non-cerevisiae subgenome of lager yeast is of Asian origin (Bing et al., 2014). However, recent genomic studies using novel S. eubayanus isolates have shed new light into this issue, suggesting that a primary dispersal from South America into the Holarctic may be more likely based on the rela-tive diversities of the Holarctic and one of the two Patagonian subpopulations and the confinement of a signature of recent demographic expansion to the Tibetan subpopulation (Peris et al., 2016).
The brewing properties of S. eubayanus (type strain) have been analysed and found to be more similar to those of Saaz strains than to those of Frohberg strains (Gibson et al., 2013). S. eubayanus-Saaz were least sensitive to cold (10°C) and unable to use maltotriose. At 22°C S. eubayanus performed poorly, producing less ethanol, even when com-pared with Saaz strains. Besides being investigated as a brewing yeast, S. eubayanus was also used to generate de novo lager hybrids in crosses with an ale strain (Krogerus et al., 2015; Hebly et al., 2015; Mertens et al., 2015). The hybrids inherited relevant brewing properties from both parents and showed apparent  hybrid  vigour,  fermenting  faster  and producing more ethanol than the parents, thus vali-dating this strategy for the production of new lager strains. Therefore, it is possible that in the future, S. eubayanus or new hybrids containing portions of its genome, will be used industrially as brewing yeasts.

Saccharomyces kudriavzevii hybrids
S. kudriavzevii was originally known from a few strains obtained from decayed leaves and soil in Japan (Naumov et al., 1995, 2000). Subsequently, a larger set of isolates was collected from oak trees in Europe (Sampaio and Gonçalves, 2008; Lopes et al., 2010; Erny et al., 2012) and from soil, leaves, and mushrooms in Taiwan (Naumov et al., 2013). Among  the  natural  species  of  Saccharomyces, S. kudriavzevii can be considered a cryotolerant yeast since it can grow at low temperatures (≈5°C) and grows poorly at 30°C (Belloch et al., 2008;

Sampaio and Gonçalves, 2008; Arroyo-López et al., 2009). This is consistent with the observation that enrichment media incubated at low tempera-tures (10°C) readily yield S. kudriavzevii from oaks across Eurasia (Hittinger, 2013). By studying the glycolytic flux and the level of activity of individual enzymatic steps of the glycolysis, Gonçalves et al. (2011) concluded that S. kudriavzevii metabolism evolved towards a better performance at low tem-peratures, particularly in ethanol production, at the cost of heat resistance. Later, the metabolome at low temperatures was compared with the thermotoler-ant species S. cerevisiae and the main differences found were in carbohydrate metabolism, mainly in fructose metabolism (López-Malo et al., 2013). Other metabolic data in favour of the cryotolerant nature of this species were ahigher glycerol level and a lower ethanol content of S. kudriavzevii compared with S. cerevisiae at low temperatures (14°C), which was due to a higher glycerol-3-phosphate dehydro-genase activity (Arroyo-López et al., 2010). Strains of S. kudriavzevii showed also higher percentages of medium-chain fatty acids and squalene regard-less of the growth temperature in comparison to S. cerevisiae (Tronchoni et al., 2012). This differential lipid composition may partially explain the better adaptation of S. kudriavzevii at low temperatures. A similar comparison, made at the transcriptome level, led Tronchoni et al. (2014) to conclude that the cryotolerance of S. kudriavzevii is due to an enhanced ability to initiate a quick and eficient translation of crucial genes for cold adaptation (i.e. the cold stress marker gene NSR1 and lipid metabo-lism related genes).
The ethanol tolerance of S. kudriavzevii is rela-tively low in comparison with other Saccharomyces species, given that S. kudriavzevii shows weak or null  growth  above  5%  ethanol  (Belloch  et  al., 2008). Competitive exclusion of S. kudriavzevii by other  mesophilic  and/or  more  ethanol-tolerant Saccharomyces  species  has  been  experimentally demonstrated in laboratory mixed cultures (Sam-paio and Gonçalves, 2008; Arroyo-López et al., 2011). The low stress tolerance and thus low com-petitiveness exhibited by S. kudriavzevii probably explains the lack of reports on the occurrence of this yeast in human-related fermentations or envi-ronments, with one exception – a few isolates from a brewery in New Zealand (González et al., 2006). Hence,  the  absence  of  S.  kudriavzevii  in  most

brewing monographs is understandable. However, as already mentioned for S. eubayanus, S. kudria-vzevii might be relevant to brewing as a contributor to hybrid strains rather than as a pure lineage.
Indeed, hybrid strains combining the genomes of S. cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii have been isolated and characterized from fermenting environments, mostly  from  wine  and  cider  fermented  at  low temperatures (Groth et al., 1999; Lopandic et al., 2007). More recently, similar hybrids have been associated to beer and seem to be common in Belgian-style beers (González et al., 2008). With the implementation of genome sequencing stud-ies, strains originally assumed to be S. cerevisiae are being recognized as S. cerevisiae×S. kudriavzevii hybrids.  For  example,  González  et  al.  (2008) analysed the genomic composition of 24 brewing strains labelled as S. cerevisiae and found that 25% of them were in fact S. cerevisiae×S. kudriavzevii hybrids.  Even  triple  hybrids  of  S.  cerevisiae,  S. uvarum, and S. kudriavzevii have been identified in cider and wine (Naumova et al., 2005; González et al., 2006). On the other hand, Lopes et al. (2010) performed several genome-wide molecular analy-ses with European wild S. kudriavzevii strains and found intraspecific differences with respect to the Japanese population, in line with Hittinger et al. (2010), who showed that the two populations dif-fered considerably in their GAL gene network. A European/Mediterranean origin for the brewing hybrids has been hypothesized (González et al., 2008), and molecular analyses of independently isolated hybrids lead to the conclusion that they are the result of multiple independent hybridiza-tion events (Erny et al., 2012; Peris et al., 2012). Together, these results suggest that an important fraction of brewing strains may correspond to S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids.
In contrast with S. pastorianus, whose origin is directly connected with the brewing environment (see ‘Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis’, above), some authors believe that S. kudriavzevii hybrids might have originated in wild environments due to the low resistance of this species to the stress conditions of human-driven fermentations (Sipiczki, 2008; Arroyo-López et al., 2011). However, despite the repeated isolation of S. kudriavzevii from natural sources, hybrid strains are  only  known  from  human-driven  fermenta-tions. Nevertheless, the role of S. eubayanus and S.

kudriavzevii subgenomes in the hybrids seems to be similar, guaranteeing a good fermentative perfor-mance at low temperatures. The hybrids retained by the industry exhibit the best properties of both parental  species,  such  as  the  low-temperature fermentation abilities of S. kudriavzevii and the high ethanol resistance of S. cerevisiae (Giudici et al., 1998; Belloch et al., 2009; Arroyo-López et al., 2009). The genomic contribution of S. kudriavzevii adds to the complexity of attributes provided by the genomes of S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus in brewing environments and most probably to the properties of the final product. The limited data available on S. kudriavzevii × S. cerevisiae hybrids in brewing, starting from the low number of isolates so far analysed,  precludes  drawing  conclusions  about the prevalence of these newly discovered hybrids in beer, especially their actual contribution to the properties of the final product. Interestingly, half of the S. kudriavzevii × S. cerevisiae strains detected by González et al. (2008) were recovered from Belgian specialty beers from Trappist monasteries (Trappist beers). Bottle re-fermentation or condi-tioning is a common practice in the production of these types of beers (van Landschoot et al., 2005), which allows adjusting and/or modifying the final flavour of beer, also known as bioflavouring (Van-derhaegen et al., 2003a). Further studies are needed to elucidate whether S. kudriavzevii hybrids have a role in the primary and/or secondary fermentation stages and to determine what is their actual contri-bution to the typical flavour complexity of Belgian specialty beers.

Brettanomyces and Dekkera
Yeasts presently classified in the genus Brettano-myces were first discovered around 1903 in Great Britain  by  Clausen  (Carlsberg  Laboratories)  in English old stock beers. Their name came from mis-spelling of the name ‘Brittanomyces’, and intended to mean ‘a fungus from British beer’ (Verarchtert and Derdelinckx, 2014). These yeasts were initially classified in the genus Torula and their assignment to Brettanomyces bruxellensis (synonym of B. lam-bicus) occurred when another yeast with similar characteristics was isolated from lambic beer by Kufferath and van Laer (1921). At the same time, these authors suggested that this new yeast was responsible for the characteristic taste of lambic beer. The relationship of Brettanomyces yeasts with
100 |  Sampaio et al.


beer was consolidated when Custers (1940) char-acterized multiple strains recovered from English and Belgian beers.
The taxonomy of Brettanomyces has endured many changes over the years. The most relevant was triggered by the discovery of ascospores, i.e. the sexual stage, in some strains. Therefore, sexual (tel-eomorphic) species were classified in a new genus, Dekkera,  whereas  asexual  (anamorphic)  stages were kept in Brettanomyces (van der Walt, 1984). As discussed above (section ‘Yeast Taxonomy’), Dekkera  and  Brettanomyces  represent  the  same genus since there is no longer a taxonomic distinc-tion between sexual and asexual states (Oelofse et al., 2008). Since the name Brettanomyces is older, better known, and used more commonly in the food and beverage industries, it is expected to be prioritized over Dekkera and will be used in this sense hereafter.
Currently, five species of Brettanomyces are rec-ognized: B. anomalus (D. anomala), B. bruxellensis (D. bruxellensis), B. custersianus, B. naardenensis, and B. nanus. Except for B. naardenensis, all other species have been isolated from beer mainly as contaminants. Relevant data on each Brettanomyces species are summarized in Table 4.2. All five species can be easily distinguished using 26S rRNA gene sequences (Crauwels et al., 2014). In general, low sequence divergence was observed between strains belonging to the same species (0% to 1.4%), indi-cating that this molecular marker is relatively well conserved and a reliable tool for identification at the species level. By far, B. bruxellensis is the most relevant species for brewing either as a contaminant or as non-conventional fermentation agent.

In spite of their bad reputation as wine- and beer spoilage agents, yeasts of the genus Brettanomyces are a desired component of certain beers due to their  potent  bioflavouring  activity.  The  positive influence of Brettanomyces in brewing is mostly related to spontaneously fermented beers, such as Trappist beers or similar, and in sour beers intentionally inoculated with these type of yeasts and   sometimes   other   microorganisms   (lactic acid bacteria and/or other yeasts) (Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013). The impact of Brettanomyces on the beer organoleptic characteristics is multiple, thus explaining why they are the most well studied non-Saccharomyces yeasts for flavour modulation. A revision on this issue has been recently published (Steensels et al., 2015).
One of the most distinctive contributions of Brettanomyces to beer flavouring is the production of highly volatile ethylphenols. Two compounds, 4-ethylphenol (barnyard, medicinal, and mousy aromas) and 4-ethylguaiacol (4EG; bacon, spice, or smoky aromas), derive from two vinylphenols previously  referred  to  as  POF,  4-vinylguaiacol (4VG) and 4-vinylphenol (4VP) (see ‘Saccharo-myces cerevisiae’, above), as a result of the activity of a vinylphenol reductase (Chatonnet et al., 1992; Edlin et al., 1998). This activity is absent in S. cer-evisiae but seems to be present in all Brettanomyces species. A screening of 13 strains of B. bruxellensis, B. custersii, and B. anamolus isolated from lambic beer showed that all were eficiently able to convert ferulic acid to 4VG and then to 4EG, the latter being the most dominant volatile phenol present (Vanbeneden et al., 2008). However, the decarbox-ylation of hydroxycinnamic acid, which is mediated

by POF genes, seems to be the rate-limiting step in the formation of ethylphenols and Brettanomyces shows  higher  activity  than  S.  cerevisiae  (Van-beneden et al., 2008). However, for B. bruxellensis, the most studied species, strain heterogeneity at the 4EG production level was recorded, together with variation in terms of ploidy (2n or 3n), PCR fingerprinting, genome composition, microsatel-
lite markers, and SO2  tolerance (Vigentini et al.,
2013; Albertin et al., 2014; Crauwels et al., 2014, 2015).  A  correlation  between  genotype  groups of B. bruxellensis and their source of isolation has been shown (Vigentini et al., 2012; Crauwels et al., 2014). Employing genomic analyses, the lack of a β-glucosidase due to a specific deletion was found to be trait distinguishing beer strains from strains from other sources. This aspect may have direct impact on the ability of these strains to compete with other microbes present in the brewing envi-ronment and/or on flavour production (Crauwels et al., 2015). Since wine isolates of B. bruxellensis outnumber by far those isolated from beer, cur-rent knowledge on the brewing attributes of these yeasts is still fragmentary. Additional isolations of B. bruxellensis from different beer sources are cru-cial to further illuminate our understanding of the prevalence of this yeast in specific beers.
It has been suggested that B. bruxellensis may have the ability to rapidly adhere to surfaces in low-nutrient environments, thus allowing the formation of strong biofilms (Joseph et al., 2007) that would generate protection against several stress factors such as the disinfectants used in breweries. This is consistent with the hypothesis that this yeast may persist in brewery environments for extended peri-ods of time (Suzuki et al., 2008). However, little is known about the dynamics of this yeast within the brewery environment, and even less is known about the ecology and natural habitats of Brettanomyces outside the brewery. It was recently hypothesized that some of the potent flavouring compounds synthesized by Brettanomyces (ethyl phenols) play a crucial role in the dispersal through insect vectors in nature (Dweck et al., 2015). We anticipate that finding the wild genetic stocks of domesticated microbes such as members of the genus Brettano-myces will contribute not only to understanding their natural history but also to identifying and manipulating the genetic changes that are relevant for brewing.

The microbiota of Belgian specialty beers and other non-conventional brewing yeasts
Fermentation of most beers worldwide depends on a monoculture process using either S. cerevisiae or  S.  pastorianus.  In  contrast,  the  fermentation and/or maturation of some Belgian beers is deter-mined by non-conventional yeasts belonging to the autochthonous non-starter community or to uncharacterized mixed starter cultures (Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995; Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005; see Chapter 7). These beers represent cul-turally important alcoholic beverages for which complex microbial communities play critical roles, both for production and for quality aspects. Indeed, the  end  products  of  these  fermentations  have unique flavours that are gaining popularity world-wide (Snauwaert et al., 2016). It is clear that, either as hybrids or as pure lineages, non-conventional yeasts have a major role in flavour modulation of specialty beers, members of the genus Brettano-myces being those with greater impact in the beer industry (Vanderhaegen et al., 2003a).
Belgian beers are peculiar in several respects. Unique herbs, spices, and fruits are often used, as well as pale or dark candy sugars, caramelized or aromatic malts, and honey. Also, the use of wooden vessels and the practice of bottle condi-tioning are typical of Belgian-style brewing. Most top-fermented Belgian specialty beers experience a secondary fermentation in the bottle (van Land-schoot et al., 2005). To achieve bottle conditioning, mature beer is inoculated with yeast (not necessary the same used for primary fermentation) and a fermentable sugar is added. As a consequence, a re-fermentation takes place, normally lasting less than 2 weeks. The secondary fermentation in the bottle results in a fully saturated beer with an enriched flavour perception and prolonged flavour stability. Phenolic compounds such as 4VG and 4VP, and in some cases 4EG and 4EP, give Belgian-style beers their unique flavour complexity, dominated by spicy clove-like and medicinal aromas (Vander-haegen et al., 2003b). These have been historically catalogued as POF. As indicated previously (see ‘Saccharomyces cerevisiae’), POF are atypical for most beers, though they are considered a trait marker of Belgian beers such as Trappist and abbey beers, and witbier (brewed with unmalted wheat), as well as German weizen (brewed with malted
102 |  Sampaio et al.


wheat) and rauchbier (brewed with smoked malts) (Coghe et al., 2004). Several S. kudriavzevii×S. cerevisiae strains were found in Trappist beer with POF (Gonzalez et al., 2008), thus questioning the belief that all POF-positive yeasts used in brew-ing were S. cerevisiae. Whether the POF character of these hybrids comes from both parents or only from one of them remains unclear, given the lack of complete genome sequences or gene expression studies of such hybrids.
Trappist breweries are run by a monastic order of Cistercian monks, the Trappists. Trappist monks are  specialized  in  the  production  Belgian-style beers, particularly the more complex ones. Cur-rently, there are twelve recognized and certified Trappist breweries in the world, most of them in Belgium.  The  designation  ‘abbey  beers’  (Bières d’Abbaye or Abdijbier) was originally applied to any monastic or monastic-style beer, although it is now used for products similar in style or presentation to Trappist beers. Besides the use of S. cerevisiae×S. kudriavzevii hybrids, it is known that in the pro-duction of Orval, a Trappist beer, a strain of B. bruxellensis is intentionally used together with Sac-charomyces spp. for bioflavouring (Vanderhaegen et al., 2003a). Moreover, many breweries mimicking Trappist beers (mostly US craft breweries) use one or more Brettanomyces strains in their fermentation process.
Another  special  type  of  Belgian  beer  that employs non-conventional yeasts is lambic beer, generally known as acidic or sour beer. This beer is characterized by a spontaneous fermentation pro-cess conduced by an autochthonous microbiota and involving a succession of several bacteria and yeasts (Spitaels et al., 2014, 2015a; see Chapter 7). Gueuze is another type of acidic beer prepared by mixing young and old lambic beers that, for ageing, are re-fermented spontaneously in bottle (Spitaels et al., 2015b). In the American craft-brewing sector, American coolship ales mimic some aspects of the lambic beer production method, although beer is fermented from a single strain and growth of lactic acid bacteria is not encouraged. Bokulich et al. (2012) showed there is a predictable ecological microbial succession for these types of spontane-ous  fermentations  although  subtle  differences at  the  species-level  composition  of  the  various

communities were detected. In lambic beer, micro-bial growth starts during the overnight cooling of the cooked wort in a shallow open vessel, called the cooling tun or coolship and the spontaneous fermentation lasts for 13 years due to a prolonged maturation  process  (de  Keersmaecker,  1996). Lambic brewing is traditionally initiated during the colder months of the year (October to March), since enough coldness is needed to lower the wort temperature to about 20°C in a single night. After this, the wort, inoculated through contact with the air of the brewery, is transferred into wooden casks that are stored at 15–20°C. Lambic beer is fer-mented and matured in the same casks. Normally, a dominance of Enterobacteriaceae is observed in the first month. These bacteria are replaced in the second month by Pediococcus damnosus and Sac-charomyces spp., the latter being replaced after 6 months of fermentation by B. bruxellensis (Spitaels et al., 2014). The end product is a non-carbonated, sour beer that mainly serves as a base for gueuze or fruit lambic beers. Lambic sour beers are among the oldest types of beers still brewed and are tradi-tionally produced in or near the Senne river valley, an area near Brussels, Belgium. Whereas a diverse range of yeasts are present in lambic beers, B. brux-ellensis is the most dominant species and exerts a significant impact on the aroma (Vanoevelen et al., 1977).
Besides the most relevant species for brewing, S. cerevisiae and S. pastorianus, and those already mentioned in previous sections such as Brettanomy-ces and S. kudriavzevii, additional non-conventional yeast species have received increased interest. For example, Saccharomycodes ludwigii has been evalu-ated for the production of low- or non-alcoholic beer types (de Francesco et al., 2015), Torulaspora delbrueckii for the production of beer with a special fruity flavour (Canonico et al., 2016; Michel et al., 2016), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe for the fer-mentation of some indigenous African beer styles (Jespersen, 2003). A modern trend in the brewing industry concerns the development of new varie-ties of beer with novel flavours. Therefore, the use of less-conventional strains and species and the bioprospection  of  wild  yeasts  from  nature  will certainly be intensified in order to add interesting candidates to the pool of brewing yeasts.

Typing and differentiation
As discussed above, brewing strains can be regarded as the main driving force in the production of beer. In addition to the other main raw materials (e.g. barley malt, hops, and water), yeast determines the flavour and character of beer. For example, wort pitched and fermented with three different brew-ing yeast strains will result in three different beers. Therefore, depending on the degree of strain-related genetic and phenotypic attributes, beer profiles can vary considerably. A practical way of comparing and differentiating strains is to perform standardized small-scale pilot fermentations. These can be fol-lowed up by sensorial and chemical analyses, which can be tailored according to the specific aim of yeast performance,  optimization,  aroma,  and  flavour characteristics of the final beer. General screening programs of brewing yeast strains usually follow a much broader approach, with a logical first step aiming at species identification, followed by the implementation of a DNA-based typing method that generates a strain fingerprint appropriate for strain  discrimination.  Afterwards  or  in  parallel, a broad variety of phenotypic methods can be applied to characterize strain-specific fermentation behaviour and to highlight strain-specific key meta-bolic components. Nowadays, there is a tendency to use high throughput systems (Steensels et al., 2014) and miniature platforms (e. g. multiwell plate sys-tems) to increase screening eficiency (Greetham, 2014). Those systems can be used to quickly gener-ate an overall picture of yeast strain performance and to identify important strain-specific metabolic pathways and key products. Selected phenotypic and DNA-based methods for yeast species and strain discrimination are listed in Table 4.3 and are evaluated according to their practical importance for brewing.

Phenotypic methods
As   mentioned   above,   a   historic,   traditional, and  valuable  approach  to  characterize  brew-ing strains consists of making a small-scale pilot fermentation with subsequent beer tasting. This phenotypic approach gives indications about yeast contribution to beer flavour and the fermentation performance under the specified conditions. It also can  be  combined  with  chemical  measurements over defined time intervals to record kinetic pro-files. In recent years, many new microbiological,

biochemical, chemical, and optical methods have been developed to characterize yeast phenotypes during the different stages of the brewing process. Basic microbiological tests such as the 37°C incu-bation method or the Melibiose-Agar Test were implemented to easily differentiate S. pastorianus lager strains from S. cerevisiae strains (Röcken and Schulte, 1986; Back, 1987; 1994; 2006; Jespersen and Jakobsen, 1996; Hutzler, 2010). Other agar plate or cultivation broth-based tests, such as the POF test (Table 4.3), were designed to interrogate specific metabolic key activities. As already men-tioned, for some German and Belgian beer types, POFs are desired flavour components and POF+ or POF– phenotypes can be determined and used to differentiate brewing strains. The determina-tion of other phenotypic characteristics can be used to generate quantitative differences between strains, such as flocculation tests or measurement of fermentation speed. Other phenotypic key char-acteristics are the ability to ferment maltotriose and to completely ferment maltose (Gibson and Liti, 2015; Vidgren et al., 2011; Hutzler et al., 2015; Schneiderbanger et al., 2013). Hence, the specific sugar utilization pattern of each strain determines the final degree of attenuation of the beer and there-fore the final alcohol concentration, which in turn contributes to mouthfeel and sweetness besides influencing the complete flavour matrix.
Flocculation is also a crucial phenotypic charac-teristic that determines the yeast handling strategy for serial re-pitching (Verstrepen et al., 2003; Holle et  al.,  2012;  Soares,  2011).  Strong  flocculating yeast strains can be cropped quite quickly from the bottom of a cylindroconical fermentation tank in order to ensure high yeast vitality. Low flocculat-ing strains, so-called ‘dusty’ strains, stay longer in suspension and often require other cropping strate-gies (e.g. later cropping, enforced cooling). Strong top-fermenting strains can even be cropped from special open tanks from above (manually or via a slide).
The strain-dependent requirements of oxygen, nitrogen sources, and zinc-ions are also crucial factors that determine yeast vitality and the ‘brew-ing phenotype’. Most data for these physiological requirements in the literature refer to specific S. pastorianus lager brewing strains. From practical experience, we know that there are pronounced strain- dependent concentration differences in the

requirements  for  essential  substrates,  especially within S. cerevisiae ale, kölsch, alt, Bavarian wheat beer, and Belgian strains.
Aside  from  the  above-mentioned  crucial  key phenotypic traits and correspondent methods to analyse them, there is an additional broad variety of phenotypic methods aimed at further under-standing strain performance at a certain time point during the production process. These include ester profiling, aroma component profiling, profiling of main fermentation products and of by-products, protein fingerprint typing/profiling, viability and vitality methods, fatty acid profiling, and others (Table 4.3). Based on a broad phenotypic under-standing  of  brewing  strains  over  fermentation, maturation, lagering, and also the understanding of the effects of yeast storage, yeast revitalization, and yeast re-pitching, the most important aspects of yeast performance and handling can be optimized according to specific production aims, e.g. faster process,  enhancement  of  specific  aroma  com-pounds, enhancement of compounds that increase flavour stability, increased mouthfeel, and other goals. Presently, knowledge about the optimization

of  strain-dependent  processes  is  only  available for a few ‘high-performance’ S. pastorianus lager strains like TUM 34/70 and for some S. cerevisiae strains that ferment special beer types, like TUM 68 used for Bavarian wheat beer (Hutzler et al., 2015; Annemueller et al., 2011). Nowadays, a quick optimization of poorly characterized strains can be achieved using a deliberately designed scheme employing phenotypic methods (Table 4.3). Addi-tionally, phenotypic methods can be implemented to control quality and performance of a specific yeast strain.

DNA-based methods
Control of species and strain identity of industrial yeasts is of crucial importance in order to maintain beer quality. As discussed above, the current gold standard  for  species  identification  is  sequence analysis of partial sequence fragments from rRNA gene domains, such as the D1/D2 domains of 26S rRNA genes and internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) (Kurtzman, 2015; Kurtzman et al., 2011; Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998, 2003). The resulting sequences can be compared to sequences
106 |  Sampaio et al.


of public or individually tailored databases (e.g. NCBI,  EBI,  Yeast  IP)  by  using  bioinformatics search and identification tools (e.g. BLAST and Yeast IP identification tool) (Weiss et al., 2013; Fernandez-Espinar et al., 2006). Also, other genes can be used for identification purposes (e.g. ACT1, HIS4, RBP1, RPB2, mtCOXII) (Weiss et al., 2013; Kopecká et al., 2016). The hybrid nature of lager yeasts must also been taken into consideration. As already mentioned, these yeasts can have two distinct rRNA gene sequences, each correspond-ing to one of the parental species. This is further complicated because there are two main lager strain types (see section ‘Saccharomyces eubayanus and Saccharomyces bayanus’), each with distinct rela-tive proportions of the two subgenomes (Hutzler et al., 2015; Brandl et al., 2005), which could lead to the preferential amplification of one of the sub-genomes in standard Sanger sequencing. For such cases, the use of specific primer pair combinations can be considered. Moreover, these or other kinds of hybrids can be adequately dealt with using NGS approaches.
Real-time PCR systems for qualitative identifi-cation of the most used brewing yeast species are shown in Table 4.4. Such a system was developed for S. eubayanus because of its recent use in brewing trials (see ‘Saccharomyces eubayanus and Saccharo-myces bayanus’). The measurement of the real-time PCR matrix in Table 4.4 enables a quick and easy identification of brewing strains at the species level and can also reveal hybrids. As mentioned above, after species identification it is important to con-firm strain identity.
In addition, monitoring the genetic purity of a strain is important for beer flavour consistency. Karyotyping, i.e. generating a chromosomal pat-tern, is regarded as the reference method for strain typing.  However,  PCR-based  typing  techniques are less laborious and easier to set up, particularly for brewing microbiology laboratories. Table 4.3 shows some of the relevant strain typing methods. It has been mentioned already that S. cerevisiae strains are genetically more heterogeneous than S. pastorianus lager strains. For the differentiation of strains of S. cerevisiae, one PCR-based typing method is suficient proof of strain identity, in most cases (Hutzler et al., 2015). For closely related S. cerevisiae strains, for example from the same beer type, one typing method often is not enough, as

in the case of discrimination between Kölsch beer and Alt beer strains. It should be noted that strain evaluation methods should desirably be able to dis-criminate different performance types, because this is a common problem encountered by brewers. Fig. 4.3 shows a fingerprint pattern of PCR-products of a partial sequence of the IGS2 intergenic spacer region (IGS2-r314 system), with subsequent capil-lary  electrophoresis  and  phylogenetic  analysis. Note that the S. cerevisiae Kölsch strain TUM 177 and S. cerevisiae Alt strain TUM 184 have very similar banding patterns. Additionally, the two S. pastorianus lager yeast strains TUM 34/70 and TUM 194 also show similar patterns. For the dis-crimination of strains within the Kölsch/Alt and the lager beer groups, at least one further typing method is recommended. The wheat beer yeast and the ale yeast strains have unique patterns in Fig. 4.3. In accordance with these results, van Zandycke et al. (2007) suggested that for most lager strains at least two typing techniques are needed. There are, however, rare cases where one strain can be typed by a single method. Kopecká et al. used a combi-nation  of  RAPD  (primer  21),  RFLP  mtDNA, karyotyping, and other methods on a brewing yeast strain set (Kopecká et al., 2016). A combination of the methods enabled a discrimination of most strains, in which RAPD (primer 21) showed a high discrimination level (Kopecká et al., 2016). Hutzler et al. (2010) used a PCR-DHPLC (dena-turing HPLC) approach that is similar to DGGE or TGGE. DHPLC employed a partial sequence of the IGS2 intergenic spacer to differentiate lager yeast strains. This method could be adjusted to separate PCR products under temperature-dependent dena-turing conditions, with a higher resolution than electrophoresis approaches (Hutzler et al., 2010). The selection of the appropriate type of strain dif-ferentiation tools depends mostly on the strains that are used in a specific brewery and should be tested with the whole strain set. The combination of methods should be able to discriminate all yeast strains within the strain set. Nowadays, besides classical sequencing approaches aiming at genes or DNA-spacers with strain specific polymorphisms, NGS approaches based on whole genome sequenc-ing may also be useful for strain differentiation and strain quality control. Such techniques are also the basis for the design of strain-specific PCR or real-time PCR systems that target strain-specific

Abstract
Brewing yeasts are notoriously dificult to work with genetically due to their complex genomes, which  are  often  polyploid,  aneuploid,  and/or derived  from  interspecific  hybridization  events. We discuss the possibilities for both traditional and non-traditional genetic manipulations of brewing yeasts as a way to combine or enhance beneficial traits already present in such yeasts, or to possibly identify and introduce novel traits from non-brew-ing yeasts. For genetically tractable yeast strains, classic  genetic  breeding  via  meiosis  and  direct mating of spores can increase genetic variability and combine desired traits. For intractable strains, non-traditional breeding methods such as rare-mating, mating by transient HO induction, cytoduction, and protoplast fusion can be utilized. These various techniques can also be performed using mixed pop-ulations in a ‘mass-mating’ manner and/or to create interspecific hybrids. Once cells or populations with  increased  genetic  variability  are  obtained, genome shufling can create novel combinations of traits; adaptive evolution of shufled populations allows the eventual selection of strains that exhibit desired fermentation or other selectable character-istics, while high-throughput quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis can lead to insights about the actual genes that contribute to the traits of interest. The above techniques yield non-genetically modified (non-GM) yeasts. However, recent advances in ‘minimally invasive’ GM techniques that result in precise genome modifications with no remaining


foreign DNA may eventually be deemed as accept-able by consumers and the brewing industry as a way to obtain brewing yeasts with desired traits. Overall, there is a wide variety of tools available for the genetic manipulation of brewing yeasts to alter or enhance any of a number of characteristics, from fermentation behaviour to sensory profile.


Life cycle of Saccharomyces yeasts; genomes, ploidy, aneuploidy, and interspecific hybrids
Budding yeasts, which are members of the fungal genus Saccharomyces (Latin: ‘sugar fungus’), are minuscule  single-celled  organisms,  yet  they  are ultimately responsible for producing almost all of the alcoholic beverages consumed in the world, including beer, wine, sake, and distilled spirits. In the case of beer brewing, Saccharomyces yeasts are the primary biological agents that transform wort into beer, by metabolizing sugars present in the wort (mostly maltose, glucose, and maltotriose) and  converting  them  into  ethanol  and  carbon dioxide; these organisms are thus literally ‘sugar (-eating) fungi’. Yeasts, as are all fungi, are eukary-otic organisms, with their genomes organized into linear chromosomes contained within a nucleus. Yeasts also contain cytoplasmically located mito-chondria, which have their own separate genome, but this chapter will not discuss mitochondria and their genomes in further detail. For Saccharomyces

yeasts, the typical strains found in nature have a diploid genome containing two copies of each of 16 different chromosomes (16 pairs of chromo-somes, hence 32 chromosomes total in the diploid genome). Haploid cells (containing just one copy of each of the chromosomes) can exist briefly within the sexual mating cycle, derived by sporulation of the diploid cell, or can exist indefinitely as free-living cells if they are unable to mate successfully, for example due to mutations in the mating system. As illustrated in Fig. 5.1, the life cycle of typical Saccharomyces  yeasts  includes  both  asexual  and sexual phases, with both diploid and, under some conditions, haploid cells able to undergo mitosis (i.e. to divide asexually, also called ‘clonally’) in an

unlimited manner when there are suficient nutri-ents. However, when nutrients, especially nitrogen, become limiting, a diploid cell – but not a haploid – is able to progress through meiosis and produce 4 haploid spores (two spores each of two different, or ‘opposite’, mating types, called ‘a’ and ‘α’), which are resistant to desiccation and other environmen-tal stresses (see Herskowitz, 1988, for a review of the yeast life cycle). Upon resumption of nutrient availability  and  beneficial  environmental  condi-tions, the haploid spores can germinate (become metabolically active) and then divide and continue to grow asexually, or – when and if they come into contact with a haploid cell of the opposite mating type – they can undergo cell fusion and mating

Figure 5.1 Life cycle of S. cerevisiae. Yeast cells can exist in both a haploid and diploid state. Haploid cells, shown on the left side of the figure, are either mating type ‘a’ or mating type ‘α’; haploids are capable of fusing to and mating with a cell of the opposite mating type (centre-left of figure; see also Fig. 5.3A), resulting in a diploid cell that now contains the genetic material (chromosomes) from both parental haploids. The resulting diploid cell is heterozygous for the mating-type locus, and thus is called ‘a/α’, a situation that makes them incapable of mating. In nutrient-rich conditions, HO-deficient haploid cells (see main text), and all diploid cells, can proliferate by asexually (i.e. clonally) ‘budding off’ new daughter cells by mitotic division, as indicated by the circular arrowed cycles. When exposed to certain nutrient-poor conditions, diploids can undergo sporulation (meiosis followed by spore formation; right side), resulting in the conversion of a diploid cell into four haploid spores: two spores possessing mating type ‘a’ and two possessing mating type ‘α’. The spores can germinate into haploid cells when conditions improve (top and bottom arrows leading back to haploid cycles). The ‘sexual phase’ of yeast reproduction encompasses both the mating and fusion of the opposite-mating-type haploid cells that results in a diploid cell containing the genetic material of the 2 parents in a single nucleus, as well as the subsequent meiotic division of the diploid cell, which results in recombination, or genetic exchange, between the two parental sets of chromosomes, and yields 4 haploid cells whose chromosomes are recombinant, i.e. containing portions of each parental DNA (note; meiotic recombination is not indicated in this figure).

(conjugation) with that other cell to form a new diploid cell (see Merlini et al., 2013, for review). Normal  (‘wild-type’)  haploid  cells  contain  an enzyme, HO endonuclease, that causes a ‘mother’ cell (i.e. a cell that has given rise to a newly budded ‘daughter’ cell formed after mitotic, i.e. asexual, cell division) to switch its mating type to the opposite of that of the daughter cell (Cosma, 2004; Haber, 2012).  This  allows  the  mother  and  daughter haploid cells, which are in close proximity and of opposite mating types, to mate and regenerate the diploid genome very quickly after sporulation. This behaviour has been postulated as not merely acting to restore diploidy, per se, but instead to quickly restore to cells that are germinating in uncertain or variable environments the ability to make stress-resistant spores if nutrient levels fall again (Knop, 2006; Hanson et al., 2014). After mating, the result-ing diploid cells are a/α – in this state they do not express either mating type and therefore do not mate with other cells, and the HO gene (which encodes HO endonuclease) is turned off. However, haploid cells with a disabling mutation in the HO gene, such as laboratory strains with a natural HO gene mutation, or any strain that has been geneti-cally modified to introduce an HO gene mutation, will produce daughter cells that do not switch their mating type; these types of yeast strains can exist indefinitely  as  free-living,  mitotically  dividing, mating-competent haploids of a particular mating type. Note that if these cells do encounter a cell of the opposite mating type, they are able to mate with it and form a diploid cell. However, since virtually all brewing-related yeast strains do not have HO gene mutations and cannot exist as free-living, mating-competent haploids, this chapter will not discuss any types of yeast breeding and/or genetic manipulations that require such cells.

Members of the Saccharomyces genus; interspecific hybridization
Within the Saccharomyces genus, there are at least seven closely related, naturally occurring species, as  defined  in  recent  reviews  (Hittinger,  2013; Borneman and Pretorius, 2015); the two species most relevant to brewing yeasts are S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus. All seven of the Saccharomyces species have very similar genomes: a haploid complement of 16 chromosomes, with most genes (and gene order) shared among all strains; additionally, the

genomes are very similar at the DNA level. All Saccharomyces species also share the same basic life cycle and mating systems (Fig. 5.1). Interestingly, these species are able to mate with each other, i.e. haploid spores of one Saccharomyces species are able to mate with haploid spores of the opposite mating type of any of the other Saccharomyces spe-cies to form a ‘pseudo-diploid’ interspecific hybrid; this occurs both in the wild and in human-related environments (reviewed by Morales and Dujon, 2012). These interspecific hybrids are unable to eficiently proceed through meiosis, but are able to indefinitely reproduce in an asexual (clonal) manner.  Other  mechanisms,  such  as  multiple rounds  of  spontaneous  genome  duplication,  or aberrant  mating  between  diploids,  can  lead  to polyploidy (more than 2 copies of each of the basic haploid set of 16 chromosomes) within a species, and similar aberrant mating of higher ploidy cells between different species can give rise to interspe-cific hybrids of varying ploidy levels (Hittinger, 2013; Borneman and Pretorius, 2015). Finally, if a yeast cell is of diploid or higher ploidy, it can often tolerate the loss or gain of a single chromosome, or even several chromosomes, leading to a state called ‘aneuploidy’, where within a cell different chromo-somes may be present at different copy numbers (Barrio et al., 2006; Storchová, 2014).
For brewing yeasts, these concepts of ploidy and aneuploidy (i.e. chromosome numbers within a cell), as well as interspecific hybridization, are very important. Ale yeasts are typically strains of S. cerevisiae, and are diploid, or more often, are of even higher ploidy and/or are aneuploid, depending on the particular strain (Legras et al., 2007; Borneman et al., 2011; Gallone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016). In contrast, lager yeasts are interspecific hybrids that were formed by mating between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus (Libkind et al., 2011; Wendland, 2014; Gibson and Liti, 2014; Baker et al., 2015; Peris et al., 2016) (see Chapter 4). Note that, because these lager yeast strains are interspe-cific hybrids, they are not ‘true’ species. However, this was not clear when they were first studied; instead they were thought to represent unique spe-cies and were given names such as Saccharomyces pastorianus  and/or  Saccharomyces  carlsbergensis, and for convenience they are still often referred to by these names. Similarly, Saccharomyces bay-anus is the name originally given to what is now
122 |  Dunn et al.


known to be a collection of similar cold-tolerant interspecific hybrid strains, most involving Saccha-romyces uvarum and S. eubayanus as the component genomes. S. bayanus was also once thought to be a ‘pure’ Saccharomyces species, while S. uvarum, now known to be a free-living, true species, was thought to be a subspecies of S. bayanus [see Nguyen et al. (2011) and Pérez-Través et al. (2014) for detailed descriptions of the complex genomes and history of S. bayanus yeasts]. It had been known for years that the non-S. cerevisiae genome component of the lager yeast was closely related to S. bayanus and/ or S. uvarum (Rainieri et al., 2006); thus, prior to the discovery in 2011 of S. eubayanus as the ‘pure’, free-living non-S. cerevisiae component of the lager yeast genome (Libkind et al., 2011), much of the lager yeast literature uses the name S. bayanus for the non-S. cerevisiae component.
Among the lager hybrids, ploidy levels and ane-uploidy also vary from strain to strain (de Barros Lopes et al., 2002; Rainieri et al., 2006; Legras et al., 2007; Dunn and Sherlock, 2008; Hewitt et al., 2014; Wendland, 2014; Gibson and Liti, 2014; Monerawela et al., 2015; Okuno et al., 2016; van den Broek et al., 2015). It is possible that the widespread occurrence of aneuploidy and higher ploidies seen among brewing yeasts reflects selective events that give advantage to these cells in the brewing envi-ronment; indeed, polyploidy and aneuploidy have been observed to be adaptive in laboratory yeasts under  some  growth  environments  (Dunham  et al., 2002; Storchová, 2014; Selmecki et al., 2015; Sunshine et al., 2015). These altered ploidy levels can presumably be tolerated, and even selected for, because brewing yeasts are not required to pass through a sexual phase as part of their lifestyle, instead being propagated asexually in perpetuity during the brewing process. Other chapters in this book (see Chapters 4 and 6) describe the detailed characterization of the genomes of ale yeasts and hybrid lager yeasts, as well as the discovery of the S. eubayanus yeast in the wild, and how the formation of the interspecific hybrid lager yeasts may have occurred; the present chapter instead focuses on the challenges and possible benefits or drawbacks of performing directed breeding and genetic analy-ses – and possibly even genomic manipulations – on brewing yeasts. Note that in this chapter we will focus only on Saccharomyces yeasts, and not on various non-Saccharomyces yeasts or bacteria

that are used in fermentations to create lambic or other ‘wild’ or sour-type beers. Some aspects of the biology, genomics, and brewing relevance of these yeasts are discussed in other chapters of this book (see Chapters 6 and 7).

Genetic traits of interest to brewers
As  we  describe  below  the  different  genetic manipulations and genetic/genomic modification techniques that might be used to construct new brewing yeasts, keep in mind that these are tech-niques that will allow brewers to isolate, change, or introduce various traits into pre-existing pro-duction brewing yeast strains; however, it is also possible that yeast strains from other industries or from natural environments, even non-Saccha-romyces yeasts, may be commandeered for use in creating new brewing strains (Steensels and Ver-strepen, 2014; Steensels et al., 2014b). Genetic traits (‘phenotypes’) are growth behaviours and other qualities (such as production of flavour or aroma molecules) that are exhibited by particular yeast strains and that are encoded for by the genes found in the yeast genome. The different traits seen among different Saccharomyces strains are thus the result of genetic variation found between different yeast strains. Saccharomyces yeasts play a role in, and have been isolated from, many human-associated food, beverage, and industrial fermentations and environments: beer, bread, wine, distilled spirits, biofuel, sake, chocolate, coffee and many others (see, for example, Ludlow et al., 2016); Saccharo-myces yeasts also exist away from humans and have been found in many ‘wild’ or natural (e.g. tree- and soil-associated) habitats across the world (Rob-inson et al., 2016; Fig. 5.2A). The list of traits that brewers are interested in as targets for modifica-tion, i.e. the beer-related traits that almost certainly have a genetic basis and are able to be monitored or investigated during various genetic screens and manipulations, can also be kept in mind throughout the rest of this chapter. Many of the qualities and attributes of brewing yeast strains that are of par-ticular interest to brewers include:

•   improved resilience and stress tolerance •   improved eficiency of sugar utilization •   altered sugar substrate utilization
•   improved eficiency of nitrogen utilization •   improved ethanol tolerance

Figure 5.2 Genetic diversity in Saccharomyces yeasts: natural and human-made. (A) Idealized view of the world distribution of natural (‘standing’) variation within the S. cerevisiae species. Natural (‘standing’) genetic variation among yeast strains exists due to long term separation by geography and/or industrial setting; different coloured yeast cells indicate strains that differ genetically from each other (see Fig. 4 of Robinson et al., 2016 for a detailed world map of locations where S. cerevisiae strains have been isolated). Hundreds of S. cerevisiae strains, collected from around the world from both natural and human-associated (food/beverage/ industrial) settings have now had their whole genomes sequenced, giving a good sense of the amount of the natural genetic diversity that exists among this entire species (see main text). (B) Human-directed methods to generate genetic diversity and/or to introduce specific genomic changes into a single starting yeast strain. Starting with one yeast strain of interest – such as a brewing strain displaying some beneficial traits, but to which new traits are desired to be added – there are many different ways to introduce genetic changes into the strain. As detailed in the main text, some methods, such as mutagenesis or adaptive evolution, will result in new strains that are probably not considered by consumers or government agencies to be ‘genetically modified organisms’ (GMOs), while other methods, such as ‘traditional’ genetic modification approaches that result in strains carrying foreign DNA (shown as ‘NewGene’ in the figure) in their chromosomes or on a plasmid, will surely result in GMOs. Finally, there are new methods that result in precise ‘scarless’ genetic modifications to the strain (i.e. with no foreign DNA remaining in the strain); in this case ‘NewGene’ in the figure could refer to something as simple yet precise as a single nucleotide change in a gene within the strain that would confer a new function or trait to the strain. Such strains may reside in a ‘grey zone’ with regard to GMO status, being considered GMO by some consumers or governments, and not GMO by others; it is likely there will be much debate about these techniques and the status of the resulting organisms in the coming years.

•   decreased ethanol and/or caloric production
•   increased tolerance to antimicrobial compounds •   altered fermentation temperature optimum
•   controlling cell sedimentation and flocculation •   enhanced or modified flavour attributes
•   reduced vicinal diketone production
•   reduced production of hydrogen sulfide
•   avoidance of ethyl carbamate aka urethane, a car-cinogen (although more of a problem in wine)
•   modified production of phenolic compounds.

It is essential that for any trait that a yeast breeder would like to investigate, there must be a way to first generate genetic variation either across the whole genome (or if possible, just for the specific trait) within the yeast cells that will be genetically manipulated. Afterward, one must either (1) ‘select’ for yeast cells bearing the desired trait, i.e. to grow or subject a population of yeast cells in a certain environment such that only the yeast cells bearing the trait of interest will survive, and all other cells will be killed, or (2) to ‘screen’ for yeast cells bear-ing that trait, i.e. to grow or subject a population of yeast cells in a certain environment in which all cells grow, but the cells displaying the trait of inter-est can somehow be identified and isolated away from the non-trait-bearing cells, and can then be studied further. Note that the ‘screening’ approach is much more laborious than a ‘selection’ approach, and if the proportion of trait-bearing cells within a population is very low, a screening approach may be impossible. In most cases, selection or screening is carried out on plates, which allows the isolation of single (i.e. clonal) colonies. Typically, several colonies are selected and tested not for only the presence of the desired trait(s), but also tested to assure that the clones retain the necessary overall growth properties of the parent yeast; in the case of brewing yeast, this would mean making sure that the selected clones still ferment wort and produce beer to the same (or superior) specifications as the parent yeast strain.
Using classical genetics alone and/or in com-bination  with  molecular  biology  or  genomics approaches, the genes or pathways encoding some of these beer-related traits have been partially or wholly elucidated, but many remain completely uncharacterized   genetically.   Determining   the genetic underpinnings of these traits could eventu-ally allow brewers to custom-design yeast strains to

their own specifications and needs, using any of the variety of techniques described below.


Breeding and hybridization strategies currently used with brewing yeasts
As discussed above, most ale and lager yeasts are not ‘pure’ diploid organisms, but instead exhibit various levels of aneuploidy, polyploidy, and/or interspecific hybridization. This means that these strains are generally unable to proceed through meiosis to give viable haploid spores, probably due to problems with chromosome pairing during meiosis and/or other incompatibility issues that specifically arise as a result of interspecific hybridi-zation (Greig et al., 2002; Greig, 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Kao et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2015). This makes it dificult or impossible to perform typical genetic analyses, and thus typical breeding strategies, with most brewing yeasts. Recently, however, various directed breeding techniques using brewing and other industrial yeasts have been carried out with success, potentially leading to useful ways to gener-ate novel brewing yeasts.
Directed breeding, also called selective or con-trolled  breeding  or  artificial  selection  (Darwin, 1859,  1868),  is  the  process  by  which  desired phenotypic characteristics from different lineages are combined by humans, through the controlled mating of selected individuals from these lineages. For millennia, despite lacking an understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms, humans both intentionally  and  unintentionally  domesticated a variety of different organisms, including plants, animals,   and   microorganisms,   by   continually selecting individuals that displayed the phenotypic characteristics of interest and allowing only those chosen individuals to reproduce. There is evidence from many regions across the world that humans have been interacting with yeasts for more than 9000 years, almost certainly at first as a way to transform fruits and grains into intoxicating bever-ages (McGovern, 2003), possibly aiding in societal development  (McGovern,  2009;  Kahn,  2015). These early humans were not only unintentionally selecting for yeast strains that would merely survive and thrive in the somewhat harsh conditions of fruit juices or soaked grains, but were also – most likely by transferring foam from only the ‘best’

fermentations to subsequent batches – repeatedly enriching and selecting for those yeasts that made a pleasing flavour while still providing an intoxicating experience (McGovern, 2009), eventually selecting for different strains of yeasts specialized for various different types of fermentation (Legras et al., 2007). In fact virtually all of the yeast strains used in brew-ing today, possibly even including lambic and ‘wild’ beers that are not deliberately inoculated and are fermented by organisms existing in the brewery environment (see Chapter 7), are found only in association with human activity, having become totally ‘domesticated’. On the other hand, some would say (albeit in semi-jest – or possibly not), that humans have been ‘domesticated’ by yeasts to become their unwitting caretakers (Katz, 2010; Dawson, 2013).
However, after the concepts of natural selec-tion  (Darwin  and  Wallace,  1858)  and  genetic inheritance (Mendel, 1865) were introduced and understood, it became even easier to carry out directed breeding of organisms. In many cases, the inheritance patterns of different traits could be easily elucidated, leading to precise predictions of the phenotypes of offspring relative to the parents. These calculations are very simple if a trait is con-trolled by one or two genes, but the vast majority of traits are ‘quantitative’, meaning that the particu-lar trait is influenced by many genes, also called a ‘polygenic’ trait. The genes controlling such traits are called quantitative trait loci (QTL). However, statistical calculations can be used in these cases to accurately predict offspring phenotypes. Today, directed breeding is carried out in all areas of agri-culture and animal husbandry.
Yeasts capable of sexually reproducing can also be bred through this process (see Fig. 5.3A and ‘Direct mating’, below). However, as mentioned above, many brewing yeasts are essentially sterile, i.e. they do not produce viable spores. Although cases of successful ale and lager yeast breeding using rare viable spores have been reported and will be described in more detail below, in general both lager and ale yeasts are very dificult to selectively breed using traditional spore mating methodol-ogy. Furthermore, the rare surviving spores that arise after such defective meiotic events are, by definition, selected to carry traits correlated with spore survival, but in fact these traits may not be

correlated (and may even be anti-correlated) with desired brewing traits.
Several methods have been adapted to overcome the sexual limitation of brewing yeasts, with most relying on the fusion of two parental strains (usually diploid, aneuploid, or polyploid) to form a higher ploidy hybrid line via ‘rare mating’ events or ‘pro-toplast fusion’ (described in more detail below). These methods avoid sporulation – and thus the chromosomal  reduction  step  that  occurs  with meiosis – therefore sidestepping the problems of spore inviability and selection of rare viable spores that  can  occur  with  aneuploid  or  interspecific hybrid yeasts. The resulting higher ploidy organ-ism (tetraploid in the case of two diploid parental strains) ideally combines the phenotypic character-istics of both parental strains, similar to the way that standard mating of haploid spores combines those characteristics in the diploid zygote. This hybrid line may even be more genetically tractable than the aneuploid parental strains, since its increased gene complement may prevent inviability upon meiosis (Morales and Dujon, 2012). An additional benefit  of  producing  hybrids  between  already domesticated lines is increased fitness and vigour during fermentation (Plech et al., 2014; Steensels et al., 2014a). Conversely, strains resulting from forced interspecific hybridization have been shown to experience an increased rate of chromosome loss (Marinoni et al., 1999), although the magnitude of this effect is debated (Kumaran et al., 2013).
The following sections describe several differ-ent directed breeding techniques for yeast that are genetically tractable (i.e. undergo meiosis and produce viable spores), as well as techniques that circumvent the need for ‘genetically well-behaved strains’ (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). For comprehensive treatments of directed and other types of breeding methods in yeasts, see Chambers et al. (2009) and Steensels et al. (2014b).

Direct mating
Classical direct mating (Fig. 5.3B), accomplished via controlled spore-to-spore mating, requires two parental strains that produce viable spores with high eficiency, a characteristic that is generally not  found  in  brewing  yeasts,  especially  not  in lager yeasts. Ale yeasts vary in their spore viabil-ity, with some strains more capable of classical

Figure 5.3 ’Natural’ mating-based strain improvement techniques. Sexual hybridization techniques are often used as a way to generate artificial diversity in yeasts that are capable of (1) mating with each other and subsequently going through successful meiosis and sporulation (e.g. genetically well-behaved yeasts within the same species, e.g. diploid strains of S. cerevisiae), or (2) mating with each other through the natural ability of cells or spores of opposite mating types to fuse with each other (e.g. between haploid or spore-producing strains of the various Saccharomyces species). Due to the sometimes complex genetics of yeast, different techniques have been developed. Most techniques start from two parental strains (i.e. the cells shown in the top row of each panel) that have been selected for target phenotype(s), and result in diploid or higher ploidy strains that can be selected or screened for the desired phenotype. The greyscale bar at lower left indicates the strength of the phenotype, for example, dark=strong ethanol tolerance, light=weak ethanol tolerance. (A) Standard mating. For ‘standard mating’, two haploid yeast strains of opposite mating type (‘a’ and ‘α’, respectively) and which are capable of continually asexually (mitotically) dividing as haploids (due to inactivation of the HO-endonuclease; see main text) can be pre-screened for desired traits. If selection for diploid cells is possible for this combination of strains, it is very simple to mix a large mass of cells from each parent strain together, whereupon cells of opposite mating type, when located close to each other, can fuse and form ‘a/α’ diploid cells (Fig. 5.1); these can then be evaluated for presence and strength of the desired trait. If there is no selection available for diploid cells, then individual cells from each parent can be microscopically manipulated to be adjacent to each other on a petri plate (at a marked location), and the colony appearing there will be composed of the diploid cells arising from the original mating of the two cells. This technique can be performed with haploid parents of the same species, or haploid parents of different species within the Saccharomyces genus. (B) Direct mating. When one or both of the parental strains contain an active HO gene, the strains are essentially always diploid and instead of standard haploid-haploid mating, direct spore-to-spore mating must be used. Two parental strains (shown as intermediate in phenotype strength, but in the case shown, are heterozygous) are each sporulated, then the haploid spores (before they can germinate and self-mate to form diploids) are microscopically manipulated to be placed adjacent to each other on a petri plate as described above; the diploid colony of cells arising from the mating of the two spores can then be seen on the plate and chosen for further evaluation. Because the parents are heterozygous, their spores are genetically diverse as shown by the differences in colouring, and randomly choosing spores for mating will result in a wide range of the phenotype of interest. However, if a screening or selection step is applied to the spores before mating, then only those spores with the desired phenotype can be chosen for mating, leading to enhancement of the phenotype; if a DNA-based screening of a single spore is used to identify spores with known desired gene variants, this method becomes a type of ‘marker-assisted breeding’. (C) Rare mating. For ‘rare mating’, strains
are crossed without a sporulation step. This is possible because normal ‘α/α’ diploid yeasts will very rarely undergo a mating-type switch on one chromosome, yielding an ‘a/a’ or ‘a/α’ diploid cell. These cells can subsequently mate with a haploid cell of the opposite mating type as shown. It is important to note that rare
mating is not limited to the development of triploid yeasts. For example, tetraploid hybrids can be obtained if the parent on the right was an ‘a/a’ diploid cell instead of an ‘a’ haploid. (D) Mass mating and genome shufling. For ‘mass mating’, multiple parental strains, or a heterogeneous population (e.g. after mutagenesis) of the same parental strain, can be used. After mass sporulation and mixing of the resulting spores, mass mating will occur. These rounds of mass sporulation and mass mating can be repeated multiple times, a process which is one way to perform so-called genome shufling. In genome shufling, the mass-sporulation and mass-mating steps can also be replaced by protoplast fusion (Fig. 5.4B).

Figure 5.4 Other strain improvement techniques. As in Fig 5.3, parental strains are shown in the top row, and the greyscale bar at lower left indicates the strength of the phenotype. (A) Cytoduction. Cytoduction (cell fusion without nuclear fusion) can be used to transfer cytoplasmically inherited traits, such as mitochondria or other organelles between cells. It can also result in transfer of single chromosomes between nuclei. The parental strain containing the desired cytoplasmic trait first needs its KAR1 gene inactivated (shown as kar1–). Next, both parental strains are mated, if capable (if not, they can be fused by protoplast fusion). Because nuclear fusion (karyogamy) is blocked due to the kar1– defect, the heterokaryon (cell containing two unfused nuclei) subsequently divides into cells containing a nucleus of only one parent but the cytoplasmic components of both parents (=heteroplasmons). With proper genetic selection, this technique can also yield so-called disomic strains that contain the full chromosome complement of one parent plus one chromosome from the other parent. (B) Protoplast fusion. For protoplast fusion, cell walls are first removed (usually by enzymatic means), after which the cells are asexually merged by incubation in osmotically supportive medium and in high concentration so cells are in close proximity. After fusion, the cell wall regenerates and the heterokaryons may undergo karyogamy to form asexually stable hybrids. (C) HO-induced mating and hybridization. This technique allows genetic analysis of a sterile or otherwise intractable strain via a tetraploid intermediate, as well as eficient production of Saccharomyces interspecific hybrids. Each parent strain is transformed with a plasmid containing an inducible HO gene, and because each plasmid has a different dominant selectable marker, this allows selection of successful mating events on double selective media. In the example shown here, parental diploids are mated to form a tetraploid, but other starting ploidies may be used.



breeding techniques; this must be established on a strain-by-strain basis, which can be a laborious process.  Strains  also  vary  in  their  sporulation eficiency, and sporulation conditions developed for laboratory strains might not be optimal for all brewing yeasts. For example, lager yeasts prefer lower sporulation temperatures than do labora-tory S. cerevisiae strains (Bilinski et al., 1987), and sporulation conditions may thus need to be opti-mized on a strain-by-strain basis, again a laborious

endeavour. However, once viable spores have been isolated, breeding lines for future mating experi-ments can be developed.
The direct mating approach has been carried out with brewing yeasts, either with strains that have high spore viability, or with rare surviving spores, as shown by the following examples. Gjermansen and Sigsgaard (1981) isolated rare viable spores of lager yeast and established breeding lines to develop strains with fermentation performances similar to
128 |  Dunn et al.


the parental strains. Bilinski and Casey (1989) per-formed mating of rare viable S. pastorianus spores with S. cerevisiae ale strain spores, observing altered (and in some cases desired) fermentation charac-teristics. Similarly, Sanchez et al. (2012) improved the thermotolerance, osmotolerance, and ethanol tolerance of lager yeast by mating rare viable S. pas-torianus spores with spores from S. cerevisiae strains derived  from  multiple  sources.  Steensels  et  al. (2014a) used direct mating to improve the aroma characteristics in ale yeast, but first screened out yeasts that were incapable of forming stable hap-loid breeding lines. Krogerus et al. (2015) mated spores from a natural auxotrophic mutant (ura-) S. cerevisiae ale yeast strain to spores from a natural auxotrophic mutant (lys-) S. eubayanus yeast strain, and selected for prototrophy, thus isolating novel lager  yeast-type  interspecific  hybrids.  Similarly, Mertens et al. (2015) also generated novel lager-type  hybrids  without  underlying  auxotrophic mutations, by directly manipulating spores from unaltered ale yeast strains to be adjacent to spores from  unaltered  S.  eubayanus  yeast  strains,  thus allowing fusion and mating without any selection steps. In both studies many of the novel lager-type hybrids showed promising unique fermentation properties and aroma profiles not seen in produc-tion lager strains.
A very recent study has characterized the whole genome sequences of over 100 S. cerevisiae ale and other brewing yeast strains (Gallone et al., 2016), yielding a rich trove of genomic data, including polymorphisms that are known or suspected to contribute  to  industrially  relevant  phenotypes. Such knowledge can allow the use of PCR or other DNA-based assays, on a fairly large scale, to select only those segregants or cells carrying the desired genetic variants for further breeding; this has been called ‘marker-assisted breeding’ and has been used for many years in crop and livestock breeding. As a proof-of-concept for brewing yeasts, Gallone et al. (2016) created new S. cerevisiae intraspecific hybrids  with  altered  aromatic  properties  using marker-assisted breeding.
In general, however, direct mating can be labo-rious and time-consuming, especially for strains, such as many brewing strains, that sporulate poorly. Furthermore, the direct mating strategy is a gamble: because brewing strains are generally heterozygous,

meiotic segregation results in spores that can be very diverse genetically, so that some of the spores used in matings may carry inferior traits; also, it is extremely challenging to select for genes that are closely physically linked to loci that cause spore inviability. Thus, other hybridization methods have been developed that do not rely on the ability to generate viable spores, as follows.

Rare mating within or between Saccharomyces species
Diploid (and higher ploidy) yeast cells generally do not express individual mating types and therefore do not participate in mating. However, at very low frequencies these cells can undergo mating type switching to become homozygous for either the ‘a’ or ‘α’ mating type (Gunge and Nakatomi, 1972; Spencer and Spencer, 1996); they are then able to mate to a spore or cell of the opposite mating type (Fig. 5.3C). Since yeast populations can be quite large, these rare events do occur in large popula-tions. If the resulting mated cells are able to be isolated by selection or screening, hybrid strains that are triploid, tetraploid, or higher ploidy, can be obtained (de Barros Lopes et al., 2002). While rare mating has been successful in producing com-mercially used novel wine yeasts (Bellon et al., 2011, 2013, 2015), few have utilized this approach in the breeding of brewing yeasts; an example is the rare mating of S. cerevisiae ale yeast to S. bayanus to increase fermentation performance at low tempera-tures (Sato et al., 2002).

Cytoduction
Cytoduction (Fig. 5.4A) is the transfer of subcel-lular organelles between cells without the transfer of nuclear genes (Spencer and Spencer, 1996); this process can be used to specifically transfer mitochondria  and  mitochondrial  genes,  or  the virus-like-particles that cause the ‘killer’ phenotype (reviewed by Bussey, 1991; Wickner and Edskes, 2015). The use of cytoduction to introduce the ‘killer’ phenotype, as well as mitochondria, into ale and lager yeast strains has been reported (Ham-mond  and  Eckersley,  1984)  with  the  eventual goal(s) of creating brewing yeasts that could kill contaminating yeasts, or display altered fermenta-tion characteristics, respectively. The method works by fusing or mating a ‘recipient’ strain carrying a
Genetic Manipulation of Brewing Yeasts |  129


mutation (in the KAR1 gene) that makes its nucleus unable to fuse with the ‘donor’ cell’s nucleus after mating between the two cells has occurred. Cyto-plasmic contents from the donor cell can then be transferred into the cytoplasm of the recipient cell; additionally, single chromosomes can ‘leak out’ from the nucleus of the donor cell and get taken up by the nucleus of the recipient strain. Nilsson-Tillgren et al. (1981) performed early experiments using this method with lager yeasts, transferring single lager yeast chromosomes into S. cerevisiae lab strains. This allowed some genetic characteri-zation of the transferred lager chromosomes and also helped deduce the interspecific hybrid nature of lager yeasts; however this method is laborious and restricted to genetic characterization, and is thus not very useful in the development of new and improved brewing yeast strains.

Protoplast fusion
Yeast, like all fungi, have a cell wall; the S. cerevisiae cell wall is primarily made of mannoproteins, poly-saccharides, and chitin (Klis et al., 2006). When the cell wall is removed from a yeast cell, the result is a membrane-exposed protoplast (also called a spheroplast). Under electrical current, protoplasts can fuse together to form hybrid cells, which com-bine the genomes of each parental strain, resulting in a higher ploidy cell (Fig. 5.4B). The fusion prod-uct cell is capable of unlimited asexual growth, and may be capable of sexual reproduction if the paren-tal strains are genetically compatible. Studies that have used protoplast fusion to create novel yeast hybrids for brewing applications are plentiful and span several decades (Russell and Stewart, 1979; Stewart, 1981), and this approach has specifically been used to transfer the killer phenotype (Young, 1981), or to optimize characteristics such as dextrin utilization (Barney et al., 1980; de Figueroa and de van Broock, 1985), flocculation (Urano et al., 1993), and ester production (Mukai et al., 2001). Protoplast fusion also works between Saccharomy-ces yeasts and various other fungal genera, since the normal reproductive barriers are overcome by this process (Spencer et al., 1988). This idea of generat-ing intergeneric hybrids (i.e. hybrids between two organisms where each belongs not only to a differ-ent species, but to a different genus) by protoplast fusion has not been explored extensively in brew-ing yeast breeding, although it has been discussed

(Morales and Dujon, 2012; Steensels et al., 2014b), and recent examples in cider (Ye et al., 2013) and wine (Carrau et al., 1994) yeast exist.

HO-induced switching and hybridization
Another method for creating hybrids that remains unexplored  for  brewing  yeast  breeding  is  HO-induced  hybridization  (Fig.  5.4C),  which  was originally reported as a method to dissect the genetic basis of pentose utilization in a naturally occurring sterile hybrid yeast (Schwartz et al., 2012). This technique involves transforming each parent strain with a plasmid that can transiently induce expres-sion of the site-specific HO endonuclease, which facilitates mating type switching in higher ploidy cells (normally the HO endonuclease enzyme is active only in haploid cells as described in ‘Life cycle of Saccharomyces yeasts; genomes, ploidy, aneuploidy, and interspecific hybrids’ above). Each parent strain is transformed with a plasmid con-taining an inducible HO gene; each plasmid has a different dominant selectable marker, enabling easy selection of successful mating events on double selective media. The HO-induced hybridization method works on a principle similar to rare mating, where normally mating-incompetent higher ploidy cells switch to mating type ‘a’ or ‘α’; however, in this case the switch occurs at a higher rate due to HO enzyme induction. Once mating has occurred, the resulting hybrid yeast can be grown non-selectively for several generations. This causes the yeast to eject the plasmids, leaving no trace of genetic modifica-tion in the hybrid (Fig. 5.4C).
This method has been successfully used to create a tetraploid saison ale yeast hybrid (D.J. Kvitek, unpublished), formed between two parental saison yeasts with very different characteristics: parent one is a classic saison yeast with an earthy phenolic aroma profile but poor fermentation characteristics, while parent two is a very strong fermenting saison yeast with a subdued ester-dominant aroma profile. The hybrid between these yeasts produced a beer that combined the earthy aroma of parent one with the strong fermenting characteristics of parent two. The hybridization of these two strains thus elimi-nated the need to pitch multiple strains of yeast into the same wort to get the desired combination of aromas and fermentation behaviour; instead, the same results were obtained from a single hybrid

strain, making both brewing and yeast strain main-tenance  easier  and  more  streamlined.  Recently, a similar HO-induced hybridization method has been reported and used to create synthetic interspe-cific hybrid lager-, Belgian ale- and cider-type yeasts (Alexander et al., 2016). These studies suggest that this method of generating both interspecific and intraspecfic  hybrids,  especially  for  cases  where the desired parental strains do not produce viable spores, could be very useful in generating brewing yeasts with novel flavour and aroma profiles that can be further combined with desired fermentation behaviours.


Future directions for breeding and genetic manipulation of brewing yeasts
Recent advances in DNA sequencing technolo-gies, as well as novel applications of older genetic techniques – especially when such technologies are combined – hold much promise for the future development  of  brewing-related  yeast  strains. These methods, discussed below, include directed construction of hybrid yeasts, genome shufling, ‘classic’ genetic modification techniques, and recent techniques for minimally invasive genetic modifica-tions of genomes.

The future of hybrid yeasts in brewing
Novel yeast strains created through both inter-specific (mating between two strains of different species) and intraspecific (mating between two strains of the same species) yeast hybridizations have been commercialized in industries such as biofuels and wine; it does not appear that any such ‘laboratory-made’ hybrids are currently used com-mercially in the brewing industry. Whether this is due to the potential perception (warranted or not) of laboratory–made hybrids as ‘genetically modified organisms’ (GMOs), a previous failure to obtain successful beer strains through hybridization, or for other intangible reasons, it is clear that recent discoveries from whole-genome sequencing, along with advances in genetic techniques, make it easier and possibly more rewarding than ever to carry out creative hybridizations using brewing yeasts. For example, in the wine arena, interspecific hybrids

between many of the different members of the Sac-charomyces genus have been constructed via the rare mating method, using a diploid wine yeast as the S. cerevisiae parent; the resulting hybrids often pro-vide unique and desirable sensory characteristics to wine, and some of the strains are now being used commercially (Bellon et al., 2011, 2013, 2015).
There is some movement towards these types of studies in the beer arena. With the recent discovery of free-living S. eubayanus as the non-S. cerevisiae component of the lager yeast genome (Libkind et al., 2011), novel lager-like yeast hybrids are begin-ning to be deliberately constructed to create strains with unique fermentation, flavour, and aroma char-acteristics, as discussed above in the ‘Direct mating’ section (Krogerus et al., 2015; Mertens et al., 2016). Phenotypic screens of ale yeasts (see, for example, Steensels et al., 2014a), including ‘heirloom’ strains (see, for example, Parker et al., 2014), has high-lighted the diversity that exists for aroma profiles and other traits among these yeasts (Fig. 5.2A). The wide spectrum of different ale yeasts that can serve as the S. cerevisiae parent, along with the very recent isolations of several genetically diverse and geo-graphically far-flung strains of S. eubayanus (Bing et al., 2014; Peris et al., 2014, 2015; Baker et al., 2015), points to an expanding universe of possible ‘lager-like’ hybrid combinations. Deliberate intraspecific hybridization (e.g. between different strains of S. cerevisiae yeasts; see discussion above of Steensels et al., 2014a, crosses of ale and sake yeasts, and Kvitek, unpublished results of crossing two differ-ent saison yeasts) appears to have been more rarely studied among brewing strains than interspecific hybridizations. This is possibly because lager beer is far and away the dominant beer style in the world, and  thus  experiments  to  optimize  lager  yeasts may be more common and/or able to be funded. Overall, experimental hybridization studies have not been thoroughly explored in a brewing context, and may provide increased genetic diversity that can subsequently be screened/selected for novel and desirable features (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). Addition-ally, intergeneric yeast hybrids – mainly obtained through protoplast fusion – have been explored in other industrial applications (Morales and Dujon, 2012; Steensels et al., 2014b) but not in brew-ing yeasts; this approach may provide a wealth of strains with even more traits of interest.
Genetic Manipulation of Brewing Yeasts |  131


Genome shuffling to combine traits and/or to discover the genetic basis of phenotypic traits in brewing yeasts
Other  genetic  techniques,  based  on  combining and/or mixing the genomes of strains, offer new possibilities for brewing yeast strain construction. Because virtually all brewing strains are non-mating (due to being of diploid or even higher ploidy, or aneuploid), it is not possible to just merely mate two such strains together to mix their genomes (as one can do with stably haploid, HO-mutant laboratory strains). However, it is often possible to perform mass mating of spores, or mass cell fusion, to rapidly combine desired traits from two or more brewing yeast strains into a single strain. These techniques can also work for starting strains that are heterogeneous, such as mixed populations (for example, a mutagenized population of cells, or a pool of meiotically recombined cells). First, a very large number of cells (or spores, if the strains can produce viable spores) from each starting ‘paren-tal’ population are generated (note that there can be one, two, or even more starting populations); they are then all mixed together, allowing random mating (if haploid cells or spores) or random cell fusion (if asexual cells are made into protoplasts) to occur. This leads to a mixing of the genotypes of the various starting populations into single cells, often resulting in cells bearing the combined traits of interest. If selection or enrichment for cells carrying the desired combination of traits is possible, several rounds of mass mating (or mass fusion) followed by selection can be performed iteratively to give further refinement or stronger expression of the desired phenotypic traits. In evolutionary terms, this  process  consists  of  genetic  recombination followed by natural selection of genotypes dis-playing advantageous phenotypes in the imposed environmental  condition,  repeated  over  several generations.
The goal in these typical mass-mating or mass-fusion methods has usually been to achieve a stable hybrid line that expresses the desired traits. Related techniques that result in ‘genome shufling’ may prove to be a valuable research tool to discover the genetic bases of phenotypic traits important in beer production, and may also be of use in generating novel strains that combine beneficial traits. Genome shufling experiments are similar to the mass-mating or mass-fusion methods, but

are performed such that genome recombination occurs at every round, eventually mixing the two starting genomes together into single cells, but in a very patchwork manner that varies from cell to cell, thus allowing different phenotypic combinations to be observed. Again, this can be used to bring together and enhance many positive traits from different backgrounds into one superior strain. But the recombined populations can also be used to map where the locations of genes controlling the traits reside. Brief descriptions of techniques and examples from the brewing industry (if available) are discussed below.

Mass mating
The traditional mass-mating protocol (i.e. mixing pools of spores; Fig. 5.3D) was employed by Wang and Hou (2010) using a diploid ale strain that spor-ulated well and produced viable spores. The starting diploid strain was subjected to both chemical and UV irradiation mutagenesis, then sporulated, and the  haploid  spores  allowed  to  mass-mate  in  a random manner. The resulting mated diploid cells were then subjected to growth under increased sugar concentrations and ethanol concentrations, and the best-growing strains were chosen to repeat the process; a total of 3 rounds were performed. This resulted in a strain that showed increased tolerance to high sugar and ethanol concentra-tions, faster fermentation times in high sugar and ethanol, higher ethanol yields, and better flavour profiles. However, this method has seen limited use for brewing yeasts due to the frequent dificulty in sporulating and mating most such strains.

Mass mating and genome shufling in asexual strains via transient HO induction
Traditional mass mating can be performed only with sexually competent yeast strains. However, it is possible that forced hybridization of asexual yeasts, via transient HO induction as discussed above (Fig. 5.4C), could yield sexually competent cells (e.g. by doubling an aneuploid or hybrid chromo-some complement to make a functionally diploid cell) that are able to proceed through sporulation and  produce  meiotically  recombined  offspring. Performing several rounds of this regime could serve as a potent genome shufling technique for genetically intractable strains, and allow screening
132 |  Dunn et al.


or selection of strains with novel combinations of beneficial traits.

Mass protoplast fusion
Another technique for performing genome shuf-fling on genetically intractable strains is based on recursive protoplast fusion: cells from the two start-ing strains (which can first be mutagenized) are stripped of their cells walls, then mixed and allowed to fuse, with the process then repeated iteratively. This technique has been used for non-brewing industrial strains of various yeasts and bacteria (reviewed by Gong et al., 2009) and has recently been performed with a diploid S. cerevisiae brew-ing yeast to yield strains with increased production of the natural antioxidant glutathione (Yin et al., 2016).

RTG/LOH-based shufling
A very recently described technique that leads to genome shufling, based on a ‘return to growth’ (RTG) strategy, essentially interrupts the process of meiosis, which is initiated when diploid cells are starved for certain nutrients. This interruption is achieved by adding back nutrients at a point after meiosis has been initiated but before any com-mitment to meiosis (and therefore before meiotic cell division) has occurred (Dayani et al., 2011; see also review by Simchen, 2009). When RTG is performed, the cells return to the mitotic growth pattern, but with an important change – their chro-mosomes have undergone meiotic recombination, which causes double-stranded breaks in the chro-mosomes; the repair of these breaks leads to regions of the chromosomes that have experienced a loss of heterozygosity. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) refers to a chromosomal region that was originally heterozygous  (where  DNA  sequences  differ  at various sites along each parental chromosome), but has become homozygous, i.e. both chromosomes now share the identical DNA sequence across that region, and thus, for that ‘LOH’ region, the cell has lost the genetic information from one of the par-ents. These LOH patches occur in different places for each different cell in the population that under-went RTG, so that within the population as a whole, most or all of each parental genome is ‘uncovered’ as an LOH patch (Laureau et al., 2016). Succes-sive rounds of RTG leads to progressively smaller LOH patches, so that eventually a population of

diploid cells is obtained in which the chromosomes are essentially entirely homozygous but contain a patchwork of contributions from each parent across a single chromosome, i.e. the genome has both been shufled and homozygosed. Importantly, this technique works even with ‘sterile’ strains that do not sporulate and/or only produce inviable spores, and furthermore, it requires no genetic modifica-tions (‘GM’; see below section 3.5) including the introduction of plasmids (even transient), making it an attractive option for brewing yeasts and other industrial  strains.  An  even  more  recent  study describes the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome edit-ing system (described below under ‘Precise genetic modifications’)  in  a  heterozygous  S.  cerevisiae diploid to produce targeted mitotic recombination events at any desired location with high frequency (Sadhu et al., 2016). Similar to RTG, this generates a population of cells with shufled genomes of LOH patches; however, the use of plasmids carrying the editing system components may be considered as ‘genetic modification’.

Genome shufling to discover the genetic basis of phenotypic traits
Once  a  genome-shufled  population  is  derived from the desired starting strains, it can be used to perform phenotypic screens to identify the gene(s) responsible for the trait; this is especially important for QTL that have many genes contributing to the trait (see Liti and Louis, 2012, for review of different QTL screening methods). Such shufling may also reveal novel beneficial genetic combinations, lead-ing to new traits of interest. If a selection is available for the phenotype of interest, the population can be subjected to the selection, such that only those cells with the phenotype survive and can be har-vested; this group of cells (the genetic ‘segregants’ showing the trait of interest) can be analysed by DNA sequencing or other whole-genome assays and compared to the un-selected population to determine which mutations or gene alleles are caus-ing the new phenotype; this type of study is called ‘bulk segregant analysis’. When used with extremely large populations, segregating for genetic and trait variation, the technique can be very powerful and specific in detecting the various genes contributing to the trait (Wenger et al., 2010; Ehrenreich et al., 2011; Parts et al., 2011). If high-throughput screens are  available  for  the  phenotype(s)  of  interest,
Genetic Manipulation of Brewing Yeasts |  133


thousands of single colonies can be picked and assayed robotically for the phenotype; those colo-nies displaying the two extremes of the phenotype are then separately pooled (one pool for each phe-notype extreme) and each pool sequenced. Those shared genetic variants found among all the clones in a given pool that are rarely or never present in the other pool can be explored as possible causal variants of the phenotype. The larger the number of clones per pool, and the more extreme the phenotypic difference between the two pools, the more sensitive bulk segregant analysis becomes for detecting the underlying genetic loci responsible for the trait (e.g. Snoek et al., 2015). The insights gleaned from these types of genome shufling stud-ies, such as the genes and pathways contributing to desired traits, can be used to construct novel brewing yeast strains either directly through genetic modifications or metabolic engineering/synthetic biology, or indirectly through adaptive evolution, as described below.

Adaptive (directed) evolution
Adaptive evolution (also called directed or experi-mental  evolution,  or  evolutionary  engineering) refers to methods of selecting among a cell popula-tion those individuals that contain beneficial genetic mutations for a particular trait; this can be done by growing the population of cells for long periods of time (i.e. many generations of cell division) under conditions that favour the beneficial mutations (Fig 5.2B). This can be performed either in repetitive steps (‘batch’ evolution), or in a long continuous manner (e.g. chemostat or other continuous cultur-ing methods), under a growth condition that favours cells with any beneficial genetic variation (i.e. that allows them to grow better in that condition). The end-point of the adaptive evolution regime is a new population that consists mainly of cells with the beneficial mutation(s). In these experiments, the genetic variation that contains such beneficial mutations either already exists in the population (e.g. the experiment starts with a mixture of geneti-cally  diverse  strains),  or  arises  by  spontaneous mutation during the evolution; the population can also be deliberately enriched for genetic variation (such as a mutagenized or genome-shufled popu-lation) prior to the evolution. Adaptive evolution can also be used on a single strain, to incrementally enhance an already existing phenotype. In these

types of experiments, the selection is not just a one-step process, but instead occurs over hundreds of generations. The strategies employed in adaptive evolution include serial transfers of batch cultures, continuous  culturing  methods,  plate  selection, and other methods. Chambers et al. (2009) give detailed examples and descriptions of various types and techniques of adaptive evolution, especially as pertaining to yeasts used in the food and beverage industries, while a recent review by Fisher and Lang (2016) describes methods, results and future direc-tions for experimental evolution studies in various fungal model systems, including Saccharomyces.

Whole-genome and high-throughput sequencing
Recent  advances  in  DNA  sequencing  technol-ogy have led to the ability to rapidly and very inexpensively (<$100; and probably <$10 in the immediate future) sequence the whole genome of a yeast strain (see Reuter et al., 2015, for an up-to-date review of high-throughput sequencing technologies); in turn, this has led to an explosion in the number of yeast genomes that have been fully sequenced – at current count, the number of S. cerevisiae whole-genome sequences in the literature and public databases is on the order of a few hun-dred, representing strains isolated from all manner of environments, including brewing-related yeasts; but this number is likely to grow into the thousands as sequencing costs fall even further. Other chap-ters in this book (see Chapters 4 and 6) will delve in much more detail into the insights about lager, ale, and other brewing yeasts that have come from the analyses of their genome sequences; we merely note here that the availability of high-throughput sequencing will be invaluable for all genetic work with brewing yeasts going forward, for example performing the types of genome-shufling QTL analyses described above, and for possible genetic modifications as described below.

Genetic modification strategies
Beer-making has been performed over many mil-lennia and has long been an occupation of much importance, both socially and economically. The brewing industry has often served as an impetus for scientific progress, especially in the areas of chem-istry and microbiology, and has even been cited as the foundation for the field of biotechnology (Bud,
134 |  Dunn et al.


1994). This is probably due to many aspects: e.g. the need for pre-processing and sterilization of wort and the ensuing need for cleaning and sterilization of equipment; the necessity of recognizing and transferring only those yeast with desired qualities into the sterile wort; the eventual isolation of pure strains of brewing yeasts and the understanding of their genetics; the monitoring and understand-ing of the resulting fermentation process; and the understanding  of  chemical  and  microbiological changes that can occur upon storage of beers. How-ever, despite the historic scientific underpinnings of beer-making, it is currently generally perceived by the brewing industry that most customers/con-sumers of beers would be unwilling to purchase or consume beers that are produced using genetically modified organisms (GMOs); there is thus much trepidation about modifying brewing yeasts using any type of technique that could be construed as ‘genetic modification’ (GM). However, the precise characteristics that comprise a GMO can be dif-ficult to define universally. On the one hand, most of  the  directed  breeding  techniques  described above, specifically directed mating, rare mating, traditional mass mating, and cytoduction, do not require any introduction of foreign DNA into the yeasts and thus most likely would not be considered by scientists, regulatory agencies, and (hopefully) the beer-drinking public as resulting from GMOs. Likewise, brewing yeasts subjected to mutagenic agents and then put through genetic screens (as dis-cussed below) are also not considered to be GMOs. On the other end of the spectrum; however, any technique yielding a yeast strain that permanently contains within its genome any ‘exogenous’ DNA – i.e. DNA that does not originate from that species of yeast, especially DNA coming from organisms not closely related to yeast – probably would be considered by scientists, regulatory agencies, and the lay public alike as a GMO (Fig. 5.2B). This type of ‘permanent exogenous DNA’ genetic modifica-tion of the yeast genome is very easy to perform due to the long history of yeast being used as a model organism in molecular biology studies; in many cases, such GMO yeasts are used in biotechnology applications to produce drugs or for bioethanol production (Steensels et al., 2014b). However, both the brewing and wine industries currently avoid the use of GM yeasts.
There   are,   however,   genetic   manipulation

methods that straddle the middle grounds in the concept of what comprises a GMO. For example, hybrid   organisms   created   through   protoplast fusion are considered in some countries to be GMOs, but not in other countries (Pérez-Través et al., 2012; Steensels et al., 2014b). Also, some plasmid-based methods, such as the HO-induction based techniques described above, are interesting because they introduce plasmids containing bac-terial and yeast DNA into a yeast strain, but only transiently; the plasmids do not interact with the nuclear genome of the cell, and after the plasmids are ejected from the cells, there is no change to the cell’s genome other than the mating-type switch, which could have occurred in a normal haploid yeast cell. Other genomic techniques can result in precise changes to the genome of a brewing yeast strain, but are changes that merely represent DNA regions from other yeasts of the same species. Finally, new techniques allow the precise deletion of genes from yeast and/or the precise addition of suites of genes, coming either from yeast or other species, that can encode entire metabolic pathways, allowing the synthesis of new molecules in the cell, a type of ‘synthetic biology’. Whether any these types of manipulations would be perceived by the public and/or regulatory agencies as representing the application of a GMO is an open question. We briefly describe some of these types of genetic modification methods below; most are described in greater detail in the review by Steensels et al. (2014b). Note that in contrast to the mating and shufling techniques described above, which aim to generate an increase in, and mixing of, genetic diversity, the GM techniques (except mutagenesis) described below offer the possibility to start with just one starting yeast strain and alter only a desired number of pre-selected genes while retaining the remainder of the strain’s genome, and thus hope-fully retaining its beneficial brewing characteristics (Fig. 5.2B).

Genome-wide mutagenesis
Brewing yeasts have been subjected to growth in the presence of mutagens, such as irradiation with UV light or treatment with ethane methylsulfonate (EMS), resulting in a population of cells carrying different spontaneous mutations in the genome that could lead to the acquisition of desired traits that can be screened or selected for (Fig. 5.2B). This

approach has been used quite widely in brewing yeasts, as the resulting strains are not considered to be GMOs. Mutagenesis has been used in combina-tion with mass mating and genome shufling (e.g. by Wang and Hou, 2010, as discussed above), but has also been used as a stand-alone method as a way to increase genetic diversity and screen for ben-eficial phenotypes. For example, a lager yeast strain was mutagenized by EMS; the resulting mutants were screened for growth in high-gravity and high-ethanol conditions, and some clones were obtained that show better growth in these conditions (Yu et al., 2012). In another study, sulfur pathway mutants of a S. cerevisiae brewing strain were obtained by performing two rounds of UV mutagenesis, com-bined with plating for cadmium sulfate resistance (to increase glutathione levels). The best candidate clone produced higher levels of sulfur dioxide and glutathione  (antioxidants),  but  lower  levels  of hydrogen sulfide (off-flavours), all of which should improve beer flavour stability (Chen et al., 2012).

Plasmid-based genetic modification Plasmids, circular pieces of self-replicating DNA usually bearing both bacterial and yeast-encoded genes and regulatory regions, represented the first method used to introduce exogenous DNA into yeast cells in the laboratory (Beggs, 1978; Hinnen et al., 1978). Such plasmids can easily be introduced (‘transformed’) into brewing yeast strains, provided that there is a dominant selectable marker on the plasmid, such as a gene that provides resistance to a drug that would normally be toxic to the brewing yeast. These are the types of plasmids that are used in the HO-induction methods to promote mating, as  described  above.  In  some  early  applications of  plasmid  technology  to  brewing  applications, libraries of plasmids – each carrying a different overexpressed yeast gene (or in some cases, genes from other organisms) – were inserted into brewing strains; the strains were then screened for beneficial traits. An interesting recent autobiographical review includes the saga of how UK government approval was pursued and achieved for a plasmid-modified brewing strain (Hammond, 2016). However, since these circular self-replicating plasmids can easily be lost from the cells upon the lack of the selective agent (e.g. a selective drug), most types of plasmid-based genetic modification are unstable and thus more often used for research purposes, as in the

example above to identify novel genes of interest, and not generally used to introduce new functions or attributes into brewing (or other biotechnology-related) yeasts destined for production use.

Chromosomal integration of DNA
Yeast cells, due to their robust homologous recom-bination  capacity,  have  an  extraordinary  ability to take up linear pieces of DNA into their cells and then precisely integrate those DNA pieces into their chromosomes, provided that the linear DNA has stretches (greater than ≈30 base pairs) at either end that exactly match the DNA on one of  the  yeast  chromosomes.  In  this  way,  novel exogenous DNA (usually as linearized plasmids, as PCR products, or as synthetic oligonucleotides), carrying genes or other genetic regions from yeast or  non-yeast  sources,  can  easily  be  introduced into yeast cells and become inserted between the two flanking matching regions into the DNA of the yeast chromosome (see Botstein and Fink, 2011, for diagrams of different types of plasmid insertions).  Note  that  there  must  generally  be a selection to enrich for cells that have actually taken up and inserted the DNA into their chro-mosome; again, as described above, for brewing yeasts the selectable marker would probably need to be a dominant drug-resistance gene. Because this novel exogenous DNA is inserted directly into the chromosome, it is permanently embedded in the yeast genome and will be transmitted to all clonal  descendants  of  that  yeast  cell,  resulting in a strain that stably retains the DNA even in the absence of further selection for the inserted DNA. Note that many industrial yeasts have less ability,  compared  to  laboratory  yeasts,  to  take up and chromosomally insert DNA, so plasmids designed to insert into repeated regions of the genome  –  such  as  ribosomal  DNA  repeats  or transposon-related sequences – have been utilized to help obtain integrants and boost expression of the inserted genes by increasing the number of possible integration sites (Lopes et al., 1989; Kudla  and  Nicolas,  1992).  Recently,  a  system that enables rapid modular construction of yeast integration plasmids, designed for integration and subsequent ‘pop-out’ using a series of selectable and counter-selectable genes, was shown to yield stable integration of multiple genes into multiple loci of yeast with precise excision of the selection

marker (Siddiqui et al., 2014); this may represent a  plasmid-based  approach  to  multilocus  yeast genetic  modifications  in  addition  to  the  tech-niques described in the next section, and may be desirable in the brewing industry (should plasmid-exposed strains become acceptable) since the final strains do not contain drug-resistance genes.

Precise genetic modifications
Methods have been developed recently that allow the direct modification of chromosomal DNA in yeast, such that there is no foreign or unwanted DNA (such as selectable gene markers) remaining in the cell’s genome. In general, the small number of dominant, counter-selectable and other auxo-trophic markers still poses a bottleneck for making modifications of multiple genes in industrial yeast strains, so any method that removes the selectable marker (and thus allows the marker to be re-used in a subsequent step) is very attractive. Most of these methods   employ   selectable/counter-selectable marker genes, such as the ‘delitto perfetto’ tech-nique, in which a DNA fragment (‘CORE’ cassette) is inserted into the genome of the starting yeast strain; the cassette contains gene(s) that are both selectable  (for  initially  detecting  cells  with  the insertion) and counter-selectable (for subsequent removal  of  the  reporter)  and  is  designed  with flanking homologous regions so that it will insert into the region of interest (Storici et al., 2001). Note that, for brewing and industrial yeasts, the selection  and  counter-selection  markers  should preferably act in a dominant fashion and not require pre-existing auxotrophic mutations (Kutyna et al., 2014; Siewers, 2014). Next, an oligonucleotide or PCR fragment that ‘covers’ the regions flanking the inserted CORE cassette and contains the desired genetic modification(s) is transformed into the cell; ‘counter-selection’ then results in the precise inser-tion, via homologous recombination, of the desired genetic modification, with concomitant deletion of the reporter gene, resulting in a ‘scarless’ genetic modification. Many types of genetic modifications can be generated with this technique, including gene  deletions,  promoter  replacement,  one-  or multigene insertion, and nucleotide substitutions (i.e. targeted point mutations; see Stuckey and Storici, 2013). A modification of the ‘delitto per-fetto’ method, where the CORE cassette now also carries both the gene for an inducible endonuclease

and the restriction site for the nuclease, generates an induced double-strand break (DSB) in the cas-sette, which greatly increases the eficiency of the process (up to 20% of cells carry the modification) by recruiting the homology-directed repair machin-ery to the site; this makes it feasible to carry out these modifications in diploid cells (Storici et al., 2003) and also allows large deletions and targeted gross chromosomal rearrangements to be obtained (Storici and Resnick, 2006). As mentioned above, a very important aspect of this technique is that it allows one to ‘rescue’ (or more accurately ‘recy-cle’) the reporter gene with each round; it can therefore be used in a series of selection/counter-selection steps to generate many different genetic modifications into a single yeast strain. While there apparently have been no reports of this method having been used for modifying brewing yeasts, a series of genetic modification steps using the ‘del-itto perfetto’ technique has recently been employed to generate wine strains producing lower ethanol than the starting strain; however, this was done in a haploid strain (Varela et al., 2012). Overall, though, the many sequential transformations needed for ‘delitto perfetto’-based multigene modifications are time-consuming, and induction of DSBs can cause unwanted mutations or genomic rearrangements (Solis-Escalante et al., 2014); it thus remains to be seen how well this type of technique can apply to industrial strains.
A particularly exciting new methodology for precise  ‘scarless’  genome  modification,  which works in virtually all organisms (even those with-out robust homologous recombination capacity), is the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Gasiunas et al., 2012; Jinek et al., 2012; also recently reviewed by Hsu et al., 2014; Sander and Joung, 2014). The basis for this technique lies in the harnessing of a bacterial RNA–enzyme interaction, originally used by the bacteria as a primitive immune response to evade viral infection. To briefly summarize this technique, the Cas9 protein, a DNA nuclease, is expressed from a self-replicating plasmid in a cell, along with a pre-designed ‘guide RNA’ (gRNA). The Cas9 protein aligns the gRNA (which needs to contain ≈20 bases matching the desired region of genome modification)  to  the  target  DNA  sequence  in the yeast genome, and then creates a DSB in the yeast chromosome at the target site. Oligonucleo-tides that ‘cover’ this chromosomal break can be

co-transformed into the cell, and just as in the ‘del-itto perfetto’ method, homologous recombination (for yeast and other cells with robust homologous recombination systems) will repair the break, but will incorporate the genetic modifications present in  the  ‘covering’  oligonucleotide  (note  that  for organisms without robust homologous recombi-nation  systems,  non-homologous-end-joining  is the usual repair method). Methods based on this genetic modification technique are proving to be successful not just in mammalian and other previ-ously intractable cells, but also in yeast (e.g. DiCarlo et al., 2013), with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic modifications approaching 100% eficiency. This means that CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for the directed modification of the yeast genome without the use of any integrated selectable markers (note that dominant drug-resistant markers are used for the Cas9 and gRNA plasmids, but cells lacking the plasmids can easily be obtained after brief growth on non-selective medium); this is truly an impor-tant  advance  for  the  modification  of  industrial yeasts. Additionally, many gRNAs, each targeting a different genomic site, can be introduced at the same time, meaning that multiple genetic modifica-tions can be made at once; this vastly speeds up the process of obtaining multilocus changes in a yeast genome, by avoiding the cycles of marker use and removal needed in the ‘delitto perfetto’ and related methods. The past 2 years have seen a flurry of research papers describing the use of the CRISPR/ Cas9 system to modify yeast genomes, with reports of up to five or six genes or chromosomal regions being modified in a single transformation (Bao et al., 2015; Jakočiūnas et al., 2015a,b; Mans et al., 2015; Stovicek et al., 2015), and even one report of a successful high-eficiency CRISPR/Cas9-induced genetic modification that was seen to occur at the desired locus on all of the homologous chromo-somes in a polyploid industrial yeast strain (Ryan et al., 2014). The latter paper also speculates that their modified CRISPR/Cas9 method (which rapidly generates marker-less barcoded gene mutations) could be used to link genes to phenotypes in indus-trial yeasts via large-scale pooled fitness studies or QTL mapping. A more recent study has directly demonstrated use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to map traits in a heterozygous diploid S. cerevisiae strain, first performing targeted LOH genome shuf-fling (discussed in RTG/LOH shufling section

above), and then using the LOH panel to very accurately and quickly map a manganese sensitivity trait (Sadhu et al., 2016); this implies that such a system could possibly be used for QTL mapping in industrial yeasts.
The recent explosion of genetic modification techniques that are both high eficiency and precise, and that can be used for diploid (or higher ploidy) prototrophic yeast cells, means that there are ample opportunities for directed modification of brewing yeasts, should the brewing industry wish to pursue this path. Two recent papers (David and Siewers, 2014; Sander and Joung, 2014) review some of the newest advances in genomic engineering tech-niques applicable for industrial yeasts, especially CRISPR/Cas9-based techniques, as well as other methods that employ endonucleases and targeted DSBs to generate targeted genome modifications.

Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology
Many yeast strains currently used in biotechnol-ogy applications (e.g. for production of fuel or drug molecules) were originally constructed by a series of plasmid integrations – often with many exogenous genes and genetic regulatory regions from non-related organisms, comprising an entirely new metabolic pathway, introduced into these yeast genomes. This ‘rewiring’ of a metabolic pathway in order to produce novel traits, or new or higher levels of a desired molecule, is often referred to as  metabolic  engineering  (Krivoruchko  et  al., 2011; Steensels et al., 2014b). The term ‘synthetic biology’ is used somewhat similarly in terms of creating new metabolic pathways in a cell, except that it often implies that the component genes and regulatory regions are synthetic (e.g. assembled from oligonucleotides and not necessarily natu-rally occurring) and/or are part of a system that integrates all the pieces easily (Krivoruchko et al., 2011; Steensels et al., 2014b), even to the level of whole chromosomes (Koszul, 2016). Aside from the sheer dificulty of obtaining yeast strains with precise  multilocus  genetic  modifications  (until recently, at least), one of the most dificult aspects of metabolic engineering is predicting how the cell will respond to the presence of novel molecules and how the altered flux of metabolites within the cell will affect cell growth; computer modelling algorithms have been designed to predict such ‘flux
138 |  Dunn et al.


analyses’ (e.g. Bordel, 2014; Borodina and Nielsen, 2014). With the availability of such algorithms, and also with the increasing number of more precise and eficient techniques for genetic modification in industrial yeast strains, especially the marker-free rapid multilocus genetic modifications that can be made by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, there are many recent reports of yeast strains designed as microbial ‘bio-factories’ that are producing molecules of inter-est at industrial scales (reviewed by Borodina and Nielsen, 2014). Finally, taking synthetic biology to its extreme, a large ongoing international research project, called the Synthetic Yeast Genome (Sc2.0) Project, has the goal of creating a yeast cell bearing an entirely synthetic genome (i.e. all chromosomes constructed by designing DNA sequences that are then synthesized in a laboratory) by the year 2018 (Dymond et al., 2011; Pérez-Través et al., 2012; Pretorius, 2016; Steensels et al., 2014). As part of this project, several synthetic chromosome arms and one entire synthetic chromosome have already been constructed and introduced successfully into yeast strains (Annaluru et al., 2014; Dymond et al., 2011). An interesting and useful twist has also been incorporated  into  the  Sc2.0  synthetic  chromo-somes: the ability to easily and densely shufle the genome at will, using a technique called SCRaM-bLE which employs an inducible recombination system, thus generating genomic diversity rapidly and easily for further selection and trait mapping purposes (Dymond et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2016). Obviously, the ability to insert any number of desired genes, in an effort to express entirely novel metabolic pathways, can be easily designed into such synthetic yeast chromosomes, and this idea has been optimistically championed for the case of wine yeast (Pretorius, 2016). At the same time, the Sc2.0 project is well aware of the ethical and safety concerns associated with the large-scale employ-ment  of  synthetic  chromosomes  and  synthetic organisms, and has taken care to address these issues publicly and propose a policy of self-regula-tion, where synthetic biology researchers follow a common set of principles including institutional and  governmental  oversight  regulations  where applicable (Pretorius, 2016; Sliva et al., 2015).
In principle, the introduction of novel meta-bolic pathways by the above-described concerted genetic modifications or even by the introduction of entire synthetic chromosomes could very well be

helpful in improving brewing yeasts’ performance in fermentation and/or in altering or improving beer sensory characteristics; however, as we have mentioned repeatedly, there is resistance to using such GM yeasts, especially those bearing ‘perma-nent’ integration of foreign (non-yeast) or synthetic DNA, in the brewing industry and for now it appears that full-scale metabolic engineering is not being attempted with brewing yeasts.


Summary
We  have  briefly  described  the  challenges  and opportunities  of  performing  different  types  of genetic  manipulations  –  both  traditional  and ‘next-generation’ – on brewing yeasts, as a way to introduce desired fermentation, flavour, aroma, or other, (possibly novel) attributes into these yeasts. Many of these manipulations, namely traditional genetic breeding or mating techniques, require no introduction of exogenous DNA into the yeasts, and therefore the resulting yeast strains would not be considered as GMOs. Other techniques – for example, those utilizing HO induction to induce mating – do introduce exogenous DNA into the strain, but in a transient manner such that no trace of genetic modification is left in the final strain. Yet other techniques, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, introduce very precise mutations into the endogenous yeast genome, such that there may be no exogenous non-yeast DNA residing in the genome of the final strain, an example of a ‘mini-mally invasive’ genetic modification.
Finally, more traditional genetic modifications and synthetic biology approaches result in strains with non-yeast DNA permanently embedded in the genome of the final strain. Whether any or all of these latter types of techniques (‘transient DNA introduction’, ‘minimally invasive modification’ or ‘permanent exogenous DNA modification’) might eventually result in production-level brewing yeast strains  that  are  ‘palatable’  to  the  beer-drinking public remains to be seen. However, it is clear that even if the genetic toolkit for producing novel brewing yeast strains remains restricted to those techniques that require absolutely no introduc-tion of exogenous DNA into the strains at any point in the process, there are still methods (e.g. direct mating either within or between species, rare   mating,   cytoduction,   spheroplast   fusion,


RTG-based genome-shufling, and adaptive evo-lution) that are available to brewers interested in creating brewing yeast strains with novel desired traits  and/or  precise  combinations  of  desired traits. The combination (with or without reitera-tive cycling) of various different techniques – e.g. rounds of mass mating alternating with mutagenesis and/or adaptive evolution, or other combinations that cycle between generating genetic variation and screening or selection – may also prove to be very useful in strain development. In general, however, these types of manipulations have not yet been widely explored in the brewing yeast field, and thus the door for genetic experimentation in brewing yeasts is wide open and promises to yield fruitful results.

Abstract
The evolutionary adaptation of organisms to a spe-cific niche is one of the most fascinating processes in biology. Classic Darwinian theory explains how the interplay between (genetic and phenotypic) variation on one hand, and selection on the other, drives evolution. For certain traits, evolutionary adaptation is forced by man-mediated selection, which results in ‘domestication’, the adaptation of organisms to man-made niches, as is commonly observed in crops, livestock, and pet animals. Yeasts serve as a very interesting model organism for adaptive evolution, since their small and compact genomes provide a very attractive and powerful model for comparative genomics and genome-evo-lution studies. Moreover, several species, such as the traditional baker’s or brewer’s yeast Saccha-romyces cerevisiae, have been subjected to natural as well as human selection, both of which shaped their genotypes and phenotypes. The emergence of whole-genome sequencing technologies resulted in an overwhelming amount of high-quality and highly detailed yeast genome sequences, allowing researchers to investigate how these yeasts inter-acted with (and adapted to) their environment. In  this  chapter,  we  describe  how  evolutionary


processes shaped the genome and phenome of three intriguing yeast species associated with beer brewing:  S.  cerevisiae,  Saccharomyces  pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis.


Introduction
Few people realize that yeast serves as an important eukaryotic  model  organism  for  basic  research. Between 2001 and 2016, five Nobel prizes (in Physiology or Medicine and Chemistry) have been awarded to researchers who used yeast to under-stand fundamental aspects of (human) biology, including cell cycle regulation, gene expression, cell ageing, autophagy and protein secretion (www. nobelprize.org). Moreover, in 1996, the baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae (strain S288c), was the first eukar-yotic organism to have its genome fully sequenced. This multimillion-dollar project was driven by an international consortium of researchers from 19 countries working in 94 laboratories, using several different  sequencing  methods  and  technologies (Goffeau, 2000; Goffeau et al., 1996). Now, two decades later, as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) becomes an almost trivial procedure, we are faced with a burst of high-quality and highly detailed

yeast genome sequences; in-depth sequencing of a yeast genome now takes only a few days and costs a few hundred dollars (Engel and Cherry, 2013; Engel et al., 2014). Consequently, to date, the whole genome sequence of hundreds of yeast species has been published, with thousands of additional genomes in the pipeline. This rich dataset makes it possible to systematically explore the interplay between genetic variation (i.e. changes in DNA sequences) and phenotypic variation (i.e. changes in properties and behaviour).
In the last 20 years, our basic knowledge of the physiology and evolution of yeasts has increased drastically.  This  growing  body  of  information is  largely  rooted  in  the  recent  development  of high-throughput techniques and analytical tools, often  called  ‘Omic’  methodologies,  that  allow simultaneous investigation of thousands of genes (genomics), transcripts (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics),  and  metabolites  (metabolomics), providing an in-depth analysis of cellular processes at a global and systems level. Using these ground-breaking techniques, several research groups have invested in large-scale characterization of diverse yeast strains (Bergström et al., 2014; Borneman et al., 2011, 2014, 2016; Dunn and Sherlock, 2008; Gallone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016; Liti et al., 2009; Schacherer et al., 2009; Strope et al., 2015).  Moreover,  while  initial  genomic  studies merely focused on a small number of laboratory isolates [e.g. S288c, a S. cerevisiae lab strain bred for easy laboratory use and therefore often not repre-sentative of natural or industrial yeasts (Warringer et al., 2011)], there is a growing interest in ‘natural’ or ‘wild’ isolates (i.e. isolated from environments not associated with human activity, such as soil or tree bark) and isolates originating from industrial niches (e.g. beer or wine fermentations). Although these studies emerged only in the past couple of years, they already yielded valuable information on genetic diversity, genome evolution, and popula-tion history and structure of industrially relevant yeast species, such as S. cerevisiae, S. pastorianus, and B. bruxellensis, which are heavily influenced by their association with man-made fermentation processes.
This  chapter  will  start  with  a  chronological overview of how yeast characterization, identifica-tion, taxonomy, and phylogeny evolved from basic phenotyping to advanced sequencing approaches.

Next, we summarize the current knowledge of the evolution and genomic features of the three main beer-related yeast species (S. cerevisiae, S. pastori-anus, and B. bruxellensis), and illustrate how these observations are related to their behaviour in a brewing environment.


From phenotyping to whole-genome sequencing
This section describes how techniques used for beer yeast typing and characterization evolved from low-resolution, error-prone, and labour-intensive phenotype-based genotyping to WGS. We focus on three species closely associated with beer brewing: the common brewer’s yeast S. cerevisiae (used in ale production), the lager yeast S. pastorianus, and Brettanomyces (Dekkera) bruxellensis, an organism involved in spontaneous beer fermentation.
Before the emergence of molecular typing tech-niques, early yeast classification and speciation was based on the yeast’s morphology and physiological properties (Boulton and Quain, 2009; Kurtzman and Fell, 1997). This is at the least remarkable, as the definition of species relies on the basic princi-ple of genetic isolation, and not on the subjective appraisal and weighting of phenotypic properties (Tornai-Lehoczki and Dlauchy, 2000). Morpho-logical differences between beer yeasts are rather limited; they are all unicellular fungi (Querol and Bond, 2009), the cellular morphology of which can vary from spheroidal to ovoidal, with multilateral budding  observed  when  clonally  reproducing. Cells occur isolated, in pairs, or sometimes as short chains or clusters, and in some conditions even as pseudohyphae (Boulton and Quain, 2009; Deak, 2008; Kurtzman and Fell, 1997; Voordeckers et al., 2012a). Besides highly similar cell morphol-ogy,  brewing  yeasts  also  generally  form  highly similar white, smooth colonies when plated on agar medium.
The shortcoming of brewing yeast classifica-tion based solely on morphological properties was already described by Pasteur in his ‘Études sur la bière’ (Pasteur, 1876) and he clearly stressed the need  for  other  classification  criteria.  Therefore, several new and more detailed typing methods were developed for the identification and classifica-tion of yeasts in the early twentieth century. These tests  were  based  on  phenotypic  identification

procedures  in  which  several  physiological  and biochemical tests were used, typically targeting the yeast’s ability to ferment different sugars, assimilate (=grow aerobically on) carbon and nitrogen com-pounds and grow in different stressful conditions (e.g.  high  or  low  temperatures  or  vitamin-free medium) (reviewed in Boulton and Quain, 2009; and Kurtzman and Fell, 1997).
Since  there  is  often  a  need  in  the  brewing industry to quickly and effectively distinguish ale (S.  cerevisiae)  and  lager  (S.  pastorianus)  yeasts, specific and rapid phenotypic tests to discriminate these two species were developed (Table 6.1) (see Chapter 4). First, these species were shown to differ in their flocculation behaviour. Flocculation is the ability of yeasts to forms flocs (clumps of cells) after the fermentation process. The flocculation process involves flocculins, which are lectin-like proteins that are associated with the cell wall of flocculating cells. These flocculins selectively bind mannose residues present in the cell wall of adja-cent yeast cells and are activated by calcium ions present in the medium. Interestingly, S. cerevisiae
ale yeast tends to adhere to the ascending CO2
bubbles towards the surface of the fermenting wort, whereas S. pastorianus lager yeast will sediment to the bottom of the fermentation vessel. This prop-erty has been ascribed to the different properties of the FLO1/Lg-FLO1 gene. The lager yeast-specific Lg-FLO1 gene can not only bind mannose residues, but also has a high afinity towards glucose residues, and is therefore responsible for the ‘NewFlo’ phe-notype of lager yeasts, and makes them to floc out to the bottom of the fermentor towards the end of the fermentation (Jin and Speers, 1998; Verstre-pen and Klis, 2006; Verstrepen et al., 2003) (see

Chapter 1). For this reason, S. cerevisiae yeast was dubbed top-fermenting yeast and S. pastorianus is generally known as the bottom-fermenting yeast. Second, they differ in their carbon metabolism. Most notably, S. pastorianus yeasts produce the extracellular  enzyme  α-galactosidase  (melibiase, encoded by the MEL1 gene), which enables the hydrolysis of melibiose into the readily assimilable sugars galactose and glucose, while S. cerevisiae is unable to do so (Boulton and Quain, 2009; Deak, 2008; Gibson and Liti, 2014; Gibson et al., 2013a). Moreover, it was also shown that S. cerevisiae yeast only can partly ferment the trisaccharide rafinose (Deak, 2008). Third, ale and lager yeasts show differences in temperature tolerance. Whereas the optimal fermentation temperature of lager yeasts was shown to be below 15°C, it is generally higher for ale yeasts, typically between 20–30°C (Querol and Bond, 2009). Additionally, ale yeasts are more tolerant towards high temperatures, and can grow at up to 41 or even 42°C, whereas lager yeasts can grow only at temperatures up to 32–34°C (Deak, 2008; Hebly et al., 2015; Meersman, 2011; Mertens et al., 2015).
Since Brettanomyces and Saccharomyces yeasts are genetically so distinct and their characteristics often differ widely, development of quick screening tests to distinguish between the two was relatively straightforward. Especially in the wine industry, where Brettanomyces is a vicious spoilage organ-ism, much research has been dedicated to develop reliable methods for detection and identification of Brettanomyces in the fermentation environment. One of the most widely used methods involves a plating assay on semi-selective media with ethanol as  carbon  source,  combined  with  bromocresol

green and/or phenolic precursors such as hydrocin-namic acids to distinguish the genus Brettanomyces from other yeasts after a long period of cultivation (Rodríguez et al., 2014).
However, it soon became apparent that yeast classification  solely  based  on  morphologic  and phenotypic characteristics was insuficient to deal with the wide variety of yeast used and found in the fermentation industry. Moreover, diverse process developments and changes in the beer-brewing industry  have  undermined  some  of  the  earlier mentioned physiologic classification markers. For example, the use of large cylindroconical fermenta-tion vessels induces ale yeast to sediment after the main fermentation to the cone, a property charac-teristic of lager yeast (Boulton and Quain, 2009). Therefore, new techniques, based on the genomic rather than phenotypic features of the yeast, were developed for the detection, identification, and classification of yeasts (Campbell, 1972; Tornai-Lehoczki  and  Dlauchy,  2000).  Moreover,  these techniques led to a new area for ecological surveys, and enabled researchers to have a closer look into the population dynamics of fermentative yeasts (Legras and Karst, 2003).
The first developed molecular method for the differentiation between lager and ale beer yeast was based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction profiling (Aigle et al., 1984). Gel electrophoresis of the resulting genomic fragments revealed that there were some clear and consistent differences between ale and lager yeasts. Moreover, the obtained pat-terns of beer yeasts (both ale and lager) were in turn very different to the patterns of non-beer yeasts, suggesting that it also is a good technique to detect possible contaminations.
In the following decades, the portfolio of molec-ular typing techniques for beer yeast differentiation was  further  expanded:  DNA–DNA  homology (Tornai-Lehoczki et al., 1996; Vaughan Martini and Kurtzman, 1985; Martini and Martini, 1987), electrophoretic karyotyping (Tornai-Lehoczki  et al., 1996; Vezinhet et al., 1990), random amplified polymorphic  DNA  analysis  (RAPD)  (Baleiras Couto  et  al.,  1994),  amplification  of  interdelta regions (Ness et al., 1993), and ribosomal RNA coding  DNA  restriction  fragment  length  poly-morphism (RFLP) (Baleiras Couto et al., 1996; Messner and Prillinger, 1995; Smole Mozina et al., 1997), or a combination of different techniques

(Tornai-Lehoczki and Dlauchy, 2000). Later, more advanced DNA-based techniques with higher reso-lution, such as microsatellite comparison (Goddard et al., 2010; Katz Ezov et al., 2006; Legras et al., 2005, 2007b); restriction site-associated sequenc-ing (RAD-seq) (Cromie et al., 2013); multilocus sequence typing (Bing et al., 2014; Fay and Bena-vides, 2005; Ramazzotti et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012); tiling array hybridization (Schacherer et al., 2009) and ultimately WGS (Liti et al., 2009) were developed and established for yeast characteriza-tion. The advent of WGS revolutionized the way to investigate and characterize genetic and phenotypic diversity in yeast. The analysis of whole genomes rapidly progressed from the study of one or a hand-ful of yeast isolates to simultaneous investigation of tens or even hundreds of individuals, enabling the development of a population genetic perspective. Examining genome-wide patterns of sequence vari-ation within and between closely related species is providing the first comprehensive view of the evo-lutionary history of S. cerevisiae, S. pastorianus and B. bruxellensis.


Saccharomyces cerevisiae – an alcohol producer tuned to perfection
In order to thrive in a fermentation environment, Saccharomyces spp. in general (and S. cerevisiae in particular)  possess  several  phenotypic  features that make them the ultimate fermentation special-ists they are today. These features arose gradually during evolution, both inside and outside man-made fermentation environments.

Natural selection shaped the Saccharomyces genome
One of the most striking attributes of Saccharomyces spp. is their perfect adaptation to sugar-rich, oxy-gen-limited environments. It was hypothesized that the emergence of fruit-bearing plants (a new niche that provided a rich, but highly competitive source of ready-to-use sugars) approximately 80–150 mil-lion years ago triggered the selection of a cascade of specific genetic adaptations, all targeted towards colonization  of  these  new  niches.  Therefore,  it seems obvious that these adaptations happened by natural selection, and no man-mediated (artificial) selection was involved.

One  of  the  most  striking  examples  is  the emergence  of  the  so-called  ‘Crabtree  effect’  in Saccharomyces.  Crabtree-positive  yeasts  show  a metabolism  in  which  glucose  (above  a  certain threshold concentration) represses respiration, so that even when oxygen is still available, cells will favour fermentation. This persistent fermentative behaviour has several advantages over respiration. First, fermentation enables a higher carbon flux and faster production of energy. Second, the main end-product of a fermentative metabolism is ethanol, which can serve as an effective antimicrobial agent, to which Saccharomyces itself is highly tolerant. Therefore, the Crabtree effect fits a make-accu-mulate-consume strategy, an ecological strategy in which ethanol is first produced and accumulated to high concentrations to inhibit the growth of other microbes and later consumed again when all fermentable sugars have been converted (Thomson et al., 2005). Apart from the Crabtree effect, there are several other physiological features that provide Saccharomyces spp. with a competitive advantage in  fermentation-like  environments  (e.g.  rotting fruit). They have evolved a high tolerance to several environmental stresses (such as high temperatures and a high concentration of osmolytes), a very high glycolytic flux, and the ability to grow in both aero-bic and anaerobic conditions (Conant and Wolfe, 2007; Goddard, 2008; Piškur et al., 2006). It is interesting to note that these individual properties are also present in various other yeasts, but they are only uniquely combined in a few species, including S. cerevisiae and its closest relatives, providing a strong competitive advantage over other wild yeasts (and bacteria) in many fermentation environments (Piškur et al., 2006).
While most of these properties are now common knowledge,  the  underlying  genetics  were  only investigated recently. While many questions remain unsolved, these studies led to the first hints towards the evolutionary pathways Saccharomyces spp. went through in response to these newly emerged niches. For example, it was shown that the duplication of several key genes, such as those encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (Hagman et al., 2013; Thomson et  al.,  2005),  hexose  transporters  (Lin  and  Li, 2011), and enzymes linked to glycolysis (Conant and Wolfe, 2007), as well as global rewiring of the transcriptional network after whole-genome

duplication (Ihmels et al., 2005), played a major role in the evolution of Saccharomyces.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the first domesticated microbe
While these adaptations, presumably to the pres-ence of fruit-bearing plants occurred millions of years prior, as described above, new opportuni-ties arose for Saccharomyces yeasts relatively more recently	(approximately	8,000–10,000	years ago). Humankind abandoned its hunter–gatherer lifestyle and introduced a horticultural tradition during the Neolithic evolution. After that, it did not take long before people realized that exposing fruits and grains to the environment (sometimes) positively changed the characteristics of these prod-ucts significantly, and additionally prolonged their shelf life. From then on, beer and other fermented beverages such as wine, sake, cider or mead were an inherent part of the human diet, as they served as a source of nutrition, as medicine, and as a vital supply  of  uncontaminated  water  (Gibson  and Liti, 2014; Hornsey, 2003; Kodama et al., 2006; Libkind et al., 2011). Later, skilled artisans found out that it paid to keep a small sample of fermented dough or beer sediment and mix this sample with a new, unfermented batch. In this way, without realizing it, they transferred specific, well-adapted microbes from one fermentation cycle to the next, thereby introducing the concept of starter cultures. During  these  consecutive  fermentation  steps, several novel superior yeast mutants and variants emerged through (mainly unintentional) artificial selection by breeding and directed evolution. It is now hypothesized that this practice induced the gradual adaptation of Saccharomyces yeasts to man-made conditions, resulting in organisms spe-cialized in specific fermentation environments but behaving suboptimal in most other, more ‘natural’ habitats, thereby making S. cerevisiae one of the oldest domesticated organisms on the planet (Fay and Benavides, 2005; Liti et al., 2009; Sicard and Legras, 2011).
Although these initial steps in microbial domes-tication  happened  haphazardly  and  are  rarely documented, genetic analysis of current biodiver-sity enables the identification of specific adaptation. Not unexpectedly, these characteristics are often unique for specific types of industrial fermentation

processes, e.g. brewing, baking, and winemaking (Borneman et al., 2011; Sicard and Legras, 2011; Spor et al., 2009; Will et al., 2010) (Table 6.2). However, it is important to note that some of these trait dissimilarities might be due rather to genetic drift and in fact pre-date or coincide with the emer-gence of synthetic fermentation environments (as suggested in Warringer et al., 2011).

Beer fermentations are a highly selective niche
Yeasts used in the beer industry provide an excel-lent model to investigate the effects of artificial selection. For example, they can be recovered and reused  after  the  fermentation  process  (unlike, e.g. bread yeasts) and are employed continuously throughout the year (unlike, for example, wine yeasts, where the fermentation scheme is tightly

linked  to  the  grape  harvest  season).  Therefore, many current beer yeast strains can be considered to be the result of a centuries-long evolution experi-ment, performed by brewers in a highly selective niche, the brewing environment. It is therefore not surprising that multiple genetic adaptations to the beer-making process have been described.
First and foremost, beer yeasts show a remark-able eficiency in utilization of maltose, the prime carbon source in beer wort. Through extensive duplication and subsequent functional divergence of subtelomeric genes involved in maltose metabo-lism,  present-day  brewer’s  yeast  is  capable  of hydrolysing a variety of sugars much more efi-ciently  than  its  ancestors  (Brown  et  al.,  2010; Charron and Michels, 1988; Dunn and Sherlock, 2008; Gallone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016; Pougach et al., 2014; Voordeckers et al., 2012b).

Another trait in which beer yeasts often excel is flocculation, and more specifically the timing of the onset of flocculation. Flocculation is the ability of cells to stick to each other and form aggregates that rapidly sediment to the bottom, or rise to the top, of the fermentation medium (see Chapter 1). This is an important trait in the beer industry, since it provides an easy and cheap way to separate the yeast cells from the finished beverage (Verstrepen et al., 2003). However, early flocculation leads to ineficient or even stuck fermentation processes. Therefore, many brewer’s yeasts have been selected to flocculate at the exact moment when all ferment-able sugars have been converted into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Moreover, some reports suggest that brewers have fine-tuned the flocculation behaviour of their yeast strain by selecting specific layers of yeast sediment for re-inoculation of a subsequent fermentation  batch  (Powell  et  al.,  2004).  The genetic basis of this phenotype, and the remark-able speed at which yeasts are able to switch their flocculation behaviour, has been studied intensively (Christiaens et al., 2012; Verstrepen et al., 2003). It was shown that flocculation behaviour is controlled by the FLO genes, encoding flocculins, and that the instability of the tandem repeats present in these  genes  enables  relatively  rapid  expansions and contractions in the gene size, thereby allowing for the fast isolation of spontaneous mutants with altered flocculation characteristics (Verstrepen et al., 2005). Lastly, recent evidence also pinpoints 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG) production (or rather the absence thereof) as an important feature of brew-ing  yeasts.  Indeed,  genetic  analysis  shows  that disruptive genetic mutations in the causative genes (PAD1 and FDC1) were heavily selected for in brewing yeasts, while this was never encountered in wild strains (Gallone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016). Interestingly, this strong adaptation to the beer environment came with a cost. General stress resistance (temperature tolerance, ethanol tolerance, salt tolerance), which is vital for survival in nature, is often impaired in brewing yeast. This loss of ‘survival skills’ is typical for domesticated organisms (imagine releasing a Chihuahua in the wilderness), and is one of the clearest signs of human interference with the organism’s evolution.
In  conclusion,  S.  cerevisiae  combines  several natural features that allow it to thrive in industrial fermentation processes. Moreover, these features

were further enhanced or specialized during domes-tication.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae phylogenetics and population structure
With  their  small  and  compact  genomes,  Sac-charomyces yeasts represent a very attractive and powerful  model  for  comparative  genomics  and genome evolution. Despite the current knowledge on the life history of wild and industrial strains being limited, recent population genetic studies provide the first steps in understanding how the Saccharomyces population is structured and strati-fied, how this evolved over time, and to what extent these processes are influenced by human interac-tions.
In 2005, Fay and coworkers analysed the genetic diversity of 81 strains of S. cerevisiae, isolated from a variety of human and natural fermentation envi-ronments, as well as sources unrelated to alcoholic beverage production (such as tree exudates and immunocompromised patients), at five unlinked genetic loci. This study provided for the first time genetic  evidence  for  domestication  events,  and established that diverged populations of wild S. cer-evisiae exist independently of domesticated isolates. This latter observation was particularly interesting, since it was commonly believed that S. cerevisiae is a domesticated species with no truly natural strains existing, and that isolates from the wild were simply escaped industrial strains (Martini, 1993; Naumov, 1996). The authors further concluded that all biodiversity of industrial S. cerevisiae strains could be traced back to (at least) two independent domestication events; one leading to the current wine, beer, and bread yeasts (most likely in Europe or the Middle East), and one leading to the current sake yeasts (in Asia). In a later study, Legras and coworkers confirmed this theory, but additionally hypothesized that since up to 28% of the genetic diversity within yeasts from the same industry was associated with geographical origin, strains were further domesticated locally in the past millennia (Legras et al., 2007).
In 2009, two seminal papers showed for the first time genome-wide maps at the nucleotide level of large collections of S. cerevisiae isolates, sampled from diverse ecological (wine, beer, spirits, bread, immunocompromised individuals, soil, etc.) and
152 |  Gallone et al.


geographical sources (Liti et al., 2009; Schacherer et al., 2009). The first study employed a high-density Afimetrix Yeast Tilling Microarray (YTM) to genetically characterize 63 diverse S. cerevisiae strains and compare them to the genome of the lab strain S288c (Schacherer et al., 2009). The second study, that gave rise to the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project (SGRP), used low-coverage (1- to 4-fold) WGS to study the haploid derivatives of 36 S. cerevisiae and 35 S. paradoxus strains. The inclusion of S. paradoxus in this study is especially interesting, since this species is the closest known relative of S. cerevisiae, but has never been associ-ated with industrial fermentation processes, and can thus be regarded as a completely non-domes-ticated species. In both studies, the authors could identify several clean subpopulations (‘lineages’) in S. cerevisiae. Liti et al. (2009) identified five (spe-cific to geographic location or ecological niches; ‘Malaysian’, ‘West African’, ‘Sake’, ‘North America’, and ‘Wine/European’) (Fig. 6.1A), while Schach-erer et al. (2009) identified three (‘Sake’, ‘Wine, and ‘Laboratory’) (Fig. 6.1B). Each clean lineage was monomorphic for the majority of segregating sites that were private within the lineage. However, it has to be noted that the strain collections used in these studies are not exhaustive, since intensive sampling revealed that at least eight more wild line-ages are present in China alone (Wang et al., 2012). Nevertheless,  these  studies  provided  valuable insight into S. cerevisiae genetic diversity, popula-tion history, and evolution. First, it was established that most wine strains, although they were col-lected from dispersed geographical locations, were members of a single subpopulation in both stud-ies. Recently, a new non-industrial sublineage has been identified within the wine group that includes Mediterranean oak isolates. Comparative genomics and demographic analysis suggested that this wild population included the ancestral genetic stock of today’s wine yeasts (Almeida et al., 2015). Further-more, the wine subpopulation showed in all studies a remarkably low level of genetic polymorphism and harboured an excess of low-frequency single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  all  features that can be explained by a population bottleneck associated to a single domestication event in wine strains, followed by human direct or accidental dispersal around the world. In 2016, WGS of 212 S. cerevisiae strains, including 106 commercial wine

starter isolates, corroborated previous findings and confirmed the presence of high level of inbreeding and substantial strain redundancy across the full catalogue of commercial wine strains (Borneman et al., 2016). As a result, the genetic diversity within these industrial strains is rather limited compared to the full spectrum of S. cerevisiae biodiversity. It was calculated that while the nucleotide diversity (π, the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two DNA sequences chosen ran-domly from the sample population) was 0.56×10–3 in 14 representative wine yeasts, a more elaborate study  of  138  strains  (including  both  industrial and wild strains) revealed a sequence diversity that was more than one order of magnitude larger (7.27×10–3)  (Wang  et  al.,  2012).  Interestingly, this diversity is much broader than observed in the human population, which is estimated to be ‘only’ 1x10–3  (Jorde and Wooding, 2004). Second, it became clear that there has been extensive transi-tion of strains from one industry to the other, as well as ‘back to nature’ events after domestication (Schacherer et al., 2009). For instance, the wine yeast lineage also included strains originating from distilleries,  immunocompromised  patients,  and natural environments. Third, it became evident that in both studies the majority of strains (including many beer, bread, and clinical isolates) did not har-bour the genome of one clean lineage, but rather included genomic fractions of various lineages, and can thus be considered as ‘recombinant’ (mosaic) strains (Fig. 6.1C and D). Interestingly, this pecu-liar population structure was not observed in the wild  species  S.  paradoxus,  supporting  the  idea that close association of S. cerevisiae with human activity facilitated crossbreeding of geographically isolated lineages and thus generation of new com-binations of pre-existing variations. This in turn resulted in phenotypically divergent variants that were in turn spread across the globe. Whereas in theory these results support the hypothesis about two independent domestication events (as raised by Fay et al., 2005), Liti et al. (2009) also proposed an alternative scenario. They argue that it is equally possible that human activity may have used existing natural strains with specific fermentation capabili-ties, providing opportunities for outcrossing and recombination between isolates originating from disparate  environments  (Goddard  and  Greig, 2015; Liti et al., 2009). Unfortunately, beer yeasts

are poorly represented in these studies, which are often biased towards natural and/or wine strains. Moreover, these studies also suffer from several technical constraints, which results in the loss of valuable genetic information. For example, both studies used S288c as a reference strain, either for genome mapping (Liti et al., 2009) or array design (Schacherer  et  al.,  2009).  Therefore,  in  2011, Borneman and coworkers documented the first de novo WGS of six industrial S. cerevisiae strains in their natural ploidy (Borneman et al., 2011). While this paper also mainly focused on wine strains (Lalvin QA23, AWRI769, Vin13, and VL3), two Australian ale-brewing strains (FostersO and FostersB) were included. These six strains were sequenced at high coverage (average 20-fold, com-pared with 1- to 4-fold in Liti et al., 2009), with a combination of shotgun and paired-end sequenc-ing,   which   resulted   in   high-quality   genomic assemblies.  Phylogenetic  analysis  revealed  that the wine and ale strains clustered in two separate populations; the wine strains clustered with the previously  established  ‘Wine/European’  lineage, while the beer strains were not part of one of the previously defined clean lineages. However, since these clusters were shown to be much more closely related to each other than to strains with origin out-side Europe, it was hypothesized that two distantly related, but both European, S. cerevisiae lineages are the ancestors of the wine and beer subgroups.
In 2016, Gallone and coworkers reported WGS and phenotyping of a collection of 157 industrial yeasts including 102 commercial beer S. cerevisiae strains, providing comprehensive insight into the evolution and diversification of brewing isolates (Gallone et al.,2016). Surprisingly, the pool of com-mercial S. cerevisiae beer isolates was not exclusively composed by ale-brewing strains, but also included 10 S. cerevisiae strains used for the industrial pro-duction of lager beers that were assumed to have been brewed using only strains of S. pastorianus (see section below, ‘Saccharomyces pastorianus – the odd one out of the Saccharomyces genus’). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of five distinct line-ages including only industrial strains, which were genetically and phenotypically separated from wild strains. Wine and sake strains clustered in the well-established ‘Wine’ and ‘Asia’ lineages (Liti et al., 2009). The majority of beer yeasts clustered in two only distantly related lineages, ‘Beer 1’ and ‘Beer 2’.

The last industrial lineage, dubbed ‘Mixed’ lineage, included all bread strains and a large portion of the ‘atypical’ beer yeasts used for bottle refermenta-tion of strong Belgian ales. These findings have the exciting implication that multiple domestication events are responsible for the present-day ale yeast biodiversity. Moreover, the large set of sequencing data allowed the authors to estimate the origin of these Beer yeast lineages. They found that the Beer 1 lineage originated around 1573–1604 ad, while the Beer 2 lineage is more recent and originated about 50 years later. This means that beer yeast domestication started well after the first reported beer production (3000–4000 bc), but before the first yeast isolation by Emil Christian Hansen, or even the discovery of microbes by Louis Pasteur, in the nineteenth century. Interestingly, the calcu-lated dates coincide with the gradual switch from home-centred beer brewing, in which every family produced their own beer, to more professional large-scale brewing, first in pubs and monasteries, and later also in breweries (Hornsey, 2003).
Gallone and coworkers further describe that whereas the specific industrial niche (wine, beer, sake, bread, etc.) was shown to have a major influ-ence  in  the  diversification  of  industrial  yeasts, the influence of geographical isolation was also observed. Most notably, the Beer 1 lineage consisted of three geographically distinct groups: ‘Belgium/ Germany’, ‘Britain’ and ‘US’. Moreover, the data point towards an English origin of US beer yeasts. It was hypothesized that English settlers introduced UK beer yeasts not long after their colonization of the New World (around 1600 ad), after which the yeasts started diverging locally, resulting in the cur-rent biodiversity. The Beer 2 lineage, on the other hand, showed absence of geographical substruc-ture and included strains originating from Eastern Europe, Belgium, Germany, UK, and US. Perhaps not surprisingly, subclustering based on beer-styles was generally not observed. This is in line with brewers’ common practice of reusing the same yeast strain for a wide variety of beers. Remarkable exceptions to this trend were identified in strains used for the production of specialty beers that are traditional to specific geographic areas, such as Hefeweizen, English stout, and Belgian Saison. These results are in line with the study of Gonçalvez et al. (2016), who performed comparative genom-ics on a set of 28 S. cerevisiae ale beer yeasts.

In conclusion, the overall picture gathered by recent studies shows how the genetic diversity of S. cerevisiae has been influenced by complex dynamics related to its close association to human technology through history, as well as by genetic drift and migration, leading to progressively geneti-cally differentiated populations. While the history of commercial beer strains was obscure for a very long time, various recent papers (Borneman et al., 2011; Gallone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016) unravelled the interesting population structure and evolution of these industrial yeasts.

The complex genome structure of S. cerevisiae ale yeasts
The recent genetic analysis of ale beer yeasts in their natural ploidy and the unbiased, de novo map-ping approach exposed various genetic elements of industrial yeast strains that remained concealed in  previous  investigations.  Major  alterations  of ploidy, large chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs), intra-strain variation between homolo-gous chromosomes, gene content variation across strains, and novel strain-specific gene clusters were identified, further emphasizing the complexity of industrial S. cerevisiae genomes (Borneman et al., 2011; Gallone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016). Many of these observations are probably a direct consequence of the lack of a sexual life cycle in ale yeasts: continuous clonal (vegetative) reproduc-tion, especially in a stressful environment, is known to lead to heterozygosity, gross chromosomal rear-rangements and poly- and aneuploidies over time (Dunham et al., 2002; Masel and Lyttle, 2011; Selmecki et al., 2008). Wine and natural strains usually possess a fully functional sexual lifecycle and  are  mostly  clean  diploids.  In  contrast,  ale strains are often obligate asexual or show little or no spore viability. For instance, Gallone and cowork-ers (2016) observed that almost half of the strains from the Beer 1 lineage were unable to sporulate, while this trait was rarely detected in the other line-ages. Furthermore, strains from the Beer 1 lineage that sporulated, produced in 80% of the cases only unviable spores.
Partial and whole chromosome copy number modifications are frequently observed in laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae (Torres et al., 2007) as well as in industrial (Dunn et al., 2012) and wild isolates (Hose et al., 2015; Liti et al., 2013). The extent of

these modifications can vary greatly according to the origin of the strains. Ale strains typically pos-sess a more irregular genomic structure and many of them are polyploid or aneuploid (Gallone et al., 2016; Legras et al., 2007; Mortimer, 2000). Interestingly, laboratory strains often show growth deficiencies when forced to acquire extra copies of chromosomes, while non-laboratory (e.g. indus-trial) yeast strains are more tolerant to aneuploidy and  display  for  some  gene  classes  gene-dosage compensation  effect  at  the  transcriptional  level (Hose et al., 2015). Indeed, Borneman and cowork-ers observed large chromosomal amplifications (a 600kb region chrII, a 200kb region of chrX, and the whole chrIII of FostersO, and the whole chrIII, chrV, and chrXV of FostersB) and deletions (a 400-kb region in chrVII and the whole chrXIV of FostersO) in beer strains, but to a lesser extent in wine and wild strains.
Copy number variations (gene duplications or deletions) can have substantial phenotypic effects and  emerging  evidence  describes  aneuploidy/ polyploidy as an evolutionary capacitor with a cru-cial role in the process of rapid adaptation to harsh environments and genetic perturbations (Ames et al., 2010; Dunn et al., 2012; Selmecki et al., 2015; Yona et al., 2012). Furthermore, in many industrial strains, such variations are more frequent in specific regions such as subtelomeric sites. For instance, subtelomeric gene families regularly subjected to contraction or expansion include sugar utilization genes, vitamins metabolism, ion transport, stress resistance,  DNA  recombination,  and  regulation of meiotic cell cycle and reproduction (see ‘Beer fermentations are a highly selective niche’, above). This suggests that in many industrial strains ane-uploidies and CNVs might be adaptive and/or linked to desirable industrial features (resistance to stress, high sugar content, extreme pH, nutrient limitations, etc.). One clear example of adaptive CNVs is the strongly increased number of MAL genes, responsible for the utilization of maltose, in ale beer yeasts (Gallone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016).
Many  industrial  S.  cerevisiae  strains  contain a high level of heterozygous SNPs compared to their  wild  counterparts.  However,  the  propor-tion of these sites was shown to vary immensely. Beer yeasts typically exhibited a higher degree of heterozygosity compared to wine yeasts, with a
156 |  Gallone et al.


5.10-fold and 2.04-fold increase of heterozygous sites detected in strains from Beer 1 and Beer 2 lineages, respectively (Gallone et al., 2016). The level of intra-strain allelic differences (i.e. heterozy-gosity) is an important indicator of the life history and provides insights into the role of asexual versus sexual reproduction, mitotic recombination, and outcrossing (Magwene et al., 2011). The high level of (heterozygous) SNPs in beer yeasts compared to wine yeasts is in line with the ‘genome renewal’ theory posed by Mortimer, in which cells with a  fully  functional  sexual  lifecycle  (such  as  the majority of wine and wild strains) can eliminate deleterious mutations (accumulated during clonal reproduction) by one round of sporulation and self-mating (Mortimer, 2000; Mortimer et al., 1994). In this context, highly heterozygous strains could rep-resent isolates that are less likely to undergo sexual cycle, preserving high degree of intra-specific vari-ability. However, an alternative hypothesis suggests that heterozygosity can also be generated through (recent) outcrossing, and human activities might have  favoured  recombination  between  strains with different genetic backgrounds. Indeed, recent population genomic studies demonstrated the pres-ence of high degrees of admixture between lineages within the global population of S. cerevisiae, with many mosaic strains identified, specifically among industrial and clinical isolates (Liti et al., 2009; Gal-lone et al., 2016; Gonçalves et al., 2016; Schacherer et al., 2009; Strope et al., 2015).

Ale yeasts: probably the oldest microbial pets known to mankind
Taken together, these findings shed light on how the combination of life history and niche adapta-tion shaped the genome of S. cerevisiae ale yeasts. It becomes increasingly clear that today’s industrial S. cerevisiae yeasts are genetically and phenotypically separated from wild stocks due to human selection and traficking. Maybe even more interesting is that the thousands of industrial yeasts that are available today seem to stem from only a few ancestral strains that made their way into food fermentations and subsequently evolved into separate lineages, each used for specific industrial applications. Within each cluster, strains are sometimes further subdi-vided along geographical boundaries, as is the case for the Beer 1 clade (Gallone et al., 2016), which is divided into three main subgroups.

However, it is important to note that strains from different fermentation environments experienced fundamentally different evolutionary paths. Con-tinuous growth in man-made, rich beer medium led to large changes in the genome (e.g. aneuploidies, major chromosomal rearrangements) and the loss of survival skills outside this specialized niche. This is in sharp contrast to wine yeasts, for example, which  experience  the  grape  must  environment only for a short period during the year and persist the rest of the time in and around vineyards or in gut of insects. Therefore, wine strains are exposed more often to natural, nutrient-poor environments, and  consequently  have  characteristics  that  are more similar to the strains encountered in the wild. Moreover, these frequent ‘back to nature’ events probably induce sporulation (sexual reproduction) and thus favour hybridization with wild yeasts. In addition, the different common practices for wine and brewing industries have a strong influence on the effective population size of yeast populations and as a consequence, on the patterns of molecular evolution and variation. Because beer is produced throughout the year and beer yeasts are recycled for a few batches of fermentation each time, trillions of cells are transferred when a new batch is inoculated. By contrast, for wine yeasts only a relatively small amount of cells will contribute to the next harvest season grape must. This has resulted in a high genetic diversity within beer yeasts compared to the more uniform wine yeast population. Together, this makes ale strains the most domesticated S. cerevi-siae strains around, and explains why they are such a perfect fit for beer fermentations. However, this also implies that these yeasts fail to perform well in more innovative brewing conditions (e.g. very high gravity brewing), as they encounter new stresses for which they are usually not adapted, while other strains from different lineages often are.


Saccharomyces pastorianus – the odd one out of the Saccharomyces genus
Lagers currently account for more than 90% of the global beer market (www.statista.com/statis-tics/270275/worldwide-beer-production/).  They are typically fermented at a lower temperature (8°C to 15°C), after which a period of cold storage (i.e. lagering, a traditional practice vital for sensorial

quality) is performed. It is believed that the lager beer production process originally was introduced in the fifteenth century in Bavaria (Germany), when brewing became legally restricted to wintertime (at colder temperatures) to minimize the microbial spoilage of Bavarian beers. Later, the advent of refrigeration  in  the  nineteenth  century  enabled lager brewing throughout the whole year (Gibson and Liti, 2014; Kodama et al., 2006; Querol and Bond, 2009). Because of the high appreciation of this type of beer, it quickly spread around the globe. The yeasts used in this practice typically sink to the bottom (and do not rise to the top) of the fermen-tation vessel towards the end of the fermentation, and are therefore often called ‘bottom-fermenting yeasts’. Interestingly, this bottom-fermenting phe-notype was described very quickly after the dawn of lager beer brewing in Nuremberg, a town in the state of Bavaria (Bond, 2009; Gibson and Liti, 2014; Hornsey, 2003; Kodama et al., 2006; Smart, 2007). In the nineteenth century, groundbreak-ing work by Louis Pasteur established that this phenomenon was caused by yeasts (Barnett, 2000; Meussdoerffer, 2009; Pasteur, 1873, 1876; Rees, 1870), and the species name S. pastorianus was first coined by the German scientist Max Rees in 1870 as a tribute to Pasteur’s work in the field. Emil Chris-tian Hansen isolated shortly thereafter the first pure yeast cultures from lager beer fermentation during his work in the Carlsberg laboratory in Copen-hagen. He classified the three isolated pure yeast lineages as separate species; one as S. pastorianus, one as Saccharomyces carlsbergenesis (‘Unterhefe Nr. 1’), and one as Saccharomyces monacensis (‘Unter-hefe Nr. 2’) (Barnett, 2000; Meussdoerffer, 2009; Regenberg  and  Hansen,  2001).  After  Hansen’s findings, starter cultures became general practice in the breweries and bottom-fermenting yeast was classified as S. carlsbergensis, disregarding the ear-lier classification of bottom fermenting yeast as S. pastorianus by Max Rees. However, genetic analysis of the various isolates in 1985 showed that the type strains of S. carlsbergensis, S. monacensis, and S. pas-torianus (the original isolates from Hansen) were almost identical, resulting in the reclassification of all bottom-fermenting yeasts to S. pastorianus (Bond, 2009; Gibson and Liti, 2014; Kodama et al., 2006; Polaina, 2002; Smart, 2007; Wendland, 2014). Furthermore, recent research has revealed

that S. pastorianus is not a true species at all, but instead an interspecific hybrid of S. cerevisiae x Sac-charomyces eubayanus (see following section and Chapter 4); nevertheless, in practice the species name S. pastorianus is still used to denote this line-age of interspecific hybrids. Because of its industrial importance, much research has been dedicated to the characterization of the lager yeast genome. This led to novel insights in the peculiar genome of this species, provided clues about its origin and shed light on some evolutionary processes that enabled this species to thrive in lager beer fermentation.

Hybrid nature of lager yeast
The physiology of lager yeasts differs fundamentally from the physiology of other brewing yeasts (Bar-nett, 2000; Pasteur, 1876; Rees, 1870). One of the most peculiar differences is the inability of S. pastori-anus to sporulate and form viable spores, a property that is still present in many ale-type (and other S. cerevisiae)  yeast  strains  (Anderson  and  Martin, 1975; Kodama et al., 2006; Snoek et al., 2015; Steensels et al., 2014). This inability to form viable offspring is a trait typically encountered in interspe-cific cross-breeding, e.g. mules (horse×donkey) or ligers (lion×tiger). Indeed, early genetic analysis showed  that  S.  pastorianus  harboured  genetic material of (at least) two different species, and was thus not a clean yeast lineage, but rather the result of a hybridization event between S. cerevisiae and another (non-cerevisiae) Saccharomyces species. The first molecular evidence of the hybrid nature of lager yeast was obtained by a technique called kar-medi-ated single chromosome transfer (Nilsson-Tillgren et al., 1981), and revealed that the chromosomes of lager yeasts could be divided into three types: (i) homologous  (cerevisiae-like)  chromosomes,  (ii) homeologous (non-cerevisiae like) chromosomes, and (iii) mosaic chromosomes, i.e. chromosomes composed of both homologous and homeologous segments. Later, these findings were confirmed by several DNA hybridization experiments (e.g. by using southern blot or S. cerevisiae-specific gene arrays) (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008; Paul Casey, 1986; Tamai et al., 1998; Yamagishi and Ogata, 1999).
By comparing the DNA sequence of 11 inde-pendent loci, Dunn and Sherlock further suggested that the S. cerevisiae parent of S. pastorianus was
158 |  Gallone et al.


closely related to ale-type S. cerevisiae strains, and not to wild isolates or strains used in other fermen-tation industries (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008). This result was in line with the previous work in which allelic variation in 12 microsatellite loci of 651 diverse S. cerevisiae and 15 S. pastorianus strains was investigated (Legras et al., 2007).
The first research suggesting a potential origin of the non-cerevisiae part of the lager genome was pub-lished in 1985 (Vaughan Martini and Kurtzman, 1985). Using DNA–DNA hybridization methods, the authors revealed a similarity of 72% between the non-cerevisiae moiety of the lager yeast CBS1513 (at that time classified as S. carlsbergensis) and S. bayanus, a cold tolerant species commonly encoun-tered in wine fermentations. This finding was later confirmed by PCR/RFLP analysis of 48 genes of the same lager yeast strain (Rainieri et al., 2006). Interestingly, this hypothesis was later questioned when it was established that part of the S. pastorianus MET2 gene showed a significant sequence differ-ence with the corresponding S. bayanus sequence, suggesting a closely related Saccharomyces species, rather than S. bayanus, as the non-cerevisiae parent (Hansen and Kielland-Brandt, 1994). In 2009, the analysis of the first whole-genome sequence of a lager strain (Weihenstephan 34/70) confirmed this hypothesis. By aligning annotated open reading frames (ORFs) of the lager brewing strain Weihen-stephan 34/70 to annotated ORFs of S. cerevisiae S288c and S. bayanus CBS7001 reference genomes, the cerevisiae-type subgenome showed very high similarity to S. cerevisiae S288c (>99%) as opposed to the bayanus-type subgenome, exhibiting lower sequence identity with S. bayanus CBS7001 (aver-age of 92.7%) (Nakao et al., 2009). Moreover, the authors identified eight genes in the lager yeast genome that were not present in the genomes of the S. cerevisiae yeast S288c nor in the genome of the S. bayanus yeast CBS7001, further indicating that probably a different, yet closely related species is the second lager yeast parent.
In 2011, Argentinean researchers sampling for cryotolerant Saccharomyces yeasts in the Patagonian forest stumbled upon a new Saccharomyces species (Libkind et al., 2011). The draft genome obtained through WGS of this species (dubbed Saccharomy-ces eubayanus), showed a remarkable high degree of similarity (99.56%) to the non-cerevisiae portion of the lager yeast genome, indicating that this species

is very likely the missing link in the S. pastorianus origin. The authors further suggest a possible sce-nario where the initial hybridization event between a diploid S. cerevisiae cell and a diploid S. eubayanus cell gave rise to an allotetraploid hybrid (the origi-nal S. pastorianus strain), which was subsequently subjected  to  extensive  genome  rearrangement and  mitotic  recombination,  resulting  in  loss  of heterozygosity  and  recombinant  chimeric  chro-mosomes. Since these adaptations occurred in the highly  selective  and  man-made  environment  of (lager) beer fermentation, they considered this the ‘domestication’ of lager yeasts (Fig. 6.2). However, several questions still remain unanswered. While S. eubayanus was originally discovered in Argentina, it is rather unlikely that lager yeasts originated in South  America.  Initially,  Libkind  and  cowork-ers  hypothesized  that  the  South  American  S. eubayanus strain was introduced in Europe via the transatlantic travel between Europe and America (Libkind et al., 2011; Peris et al., 2014). However, while transatlantic travel was only established after Columbus’ first voyage to the new world and the first reports of the bottom-fermenting phenotype predate Columbus’ travels, lager brewing yeasts most likely originated earlier (probably in the early 1400s in Bavaria) (Bond, 2009; Gibson and Liti, 2014; Hornsey, 2003; Kodama et al., 2006; Smart, 2007). More recent discoveries of genetically dis-tinct lineages of S. eubayanus in other parts of the world (North America and China) suggest that S. eubayanus is not unique to South America (Bing et al., 2014; Peris et al., 2014). Moreover, genetic evidence suggests that the non-cerevisiae moiety of the Weihenstephan 34/70 is more closely related to a S. eubayanus lineage isolated in Tibet (sequenc-ing of 12 loci indicated a 99.82% similarity to the non-cerevisiae moiety of lager yeast of the Asian S. eubayanus isolate, compared to the 99.56% similar-ity obtained by WGS with the Argentinean isolate described by Libkind et al., 2011), suggesting that this lineage is more likely the direct ancestor of this lager yeast (Bing et al., 2014). Therefore, it is now hypothesized that S. eubayanus made his way to Europe via the 2000-year-old Silk Road. Neverthe-less, S. eubayanus is up till now not yet discovered in Europe and it could be that this yeast species occupies a highly specific niche in Europe and still awaits discovery (Gibson and Liti, 2014).
However, the question of when and how S.

Figure 6.2 The origin of lager yeast.Current hypothesis about the origin of lager yeast involves (1) a contamination of ancient Bavarian fermentation (suggested to be originally conducted by ale yeast S. cerevisiae) by a wild S. eubayanus yeast contaminant; (2) a rare interspecific hybridization event between both yeast species; (3) selection of the interspecific hybrid due to its likely ability to combine the fermentation capacity and ethanol tolerance of its S. cerevisiae parent with the cold tolerance of its S. eubayanus parent; (4–5) followed by genome stabilization and diversification of the ancient S. pastorianus yeast to its current conformation. This whole process happened at least twice in history, giving rise to the two groups of lager yeasts (Saaz and Frohberg types).



eubayanus got into contact with the lager-brewing environment remains open. It is hypothesized that this event took place 500–600 years ago, triggered by a law enforcing brewing at cold temperatures in Bavaria. The non-cerevisiae parent (S. eubayanus) is thought to occur as a wild yeast contaminant around the brewing environment, and being better equipped to withstand the fermentation conditions in cold temperatures compared to the native ale yeasts. However, phenotypic analysis of the first two S. eubayanus strains isolated showed an inferior fermentation profile of S. eubayanus compared to S. cerevisiae (e.g. it is unable to ferment maltotriose, shows a lower ethanol tolerance, and produces an inferior aroma profile), prohibiting its use as starter cultures for lager beer fermentation. An interspecific hybridization event (between the S. eubayanus contaminant and the ale-type S. cerevi-siae), that probably happened within the brewing tank, resolved the shortcomings of both species, and resulted in a hybrid species (S. pastorianus) that possessed the combined advantage of cold tol-erance and fermentation capacity. This species was therefore able to outcompete its parental strains in lager beer fermentation, and was in this way (unin-tentionally) selected by the brewers, as traditionally part of the fermented beer was used to inoculate the next batch (Gibson and Liti, 2014).

Lager yeasts can be divided into two genetically and phenotypically distinct lineages
Over  the  years,  the  interspecific  hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus yeasts prob-ably occurred numerous times. However, to date, only two lineages of lager yeast remain present in industry. These two archetypes are referred to as ‘Saaz’ or ‘group I’ and ‘Frohberg’ or ‘group II’ type S. pastorianus yeasts (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008; Fabian and McCullough, 1933; Gibson and Liti, 2014; Gibson et al., 2013b; Liti et al., 2005; Walther et al., 2014). These names refer to the work of Paul Lindner (1909), who reported the isolation of two individual S. pastorianus yeast lineages, which he named ‘Saaz’ and ‘Frohberg’ after the locations in Bohemia and Germany in which these strains were originally used (Gibson and Liti, 2014; Gibson et al., 2013b; Lindner, 1909).
Today, a clear trend exists between the lager yeast archetype and the country in which these yeasts are used. Group I (Saaz type), which are not used frequently any more in industry, are mainly used in Czech breweries, as well as the Carlsberg brewery in Denmark, whereas Group II (Frohberg type) are more widespread in other European and North-American breweries (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008). While these archetypes show many similarities,
160 |  Gallone et al.


there are some interesting genetic and phenotypic differences as well.

Genetic differences
The separation of S. pastorianus yeasts into two genetically distinct groups was firstly suggested based on RFLP analysis and the analysis of trans-poson sequence distribution among different S. pastorianus yeasts (Liti et al., 2005; de Barros Lopes et al., 2002). Later, this hypothesis was confirmed by the use of array Comparative Genomic Hybridi-zation (array CGH) and DNA sequencing of the adjacent and intronic regions of 11 intron-contain-ing genes (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008). In the same experiments, it also became clear that both arche-types did not share a common ancestry. Initially, it was predicted that Saaz-type yeasts originated from a  haploid–haploid  hybridization  event,  whereas Frohberg-type yeasts derived from a diploid–hap-loid hybridization event, where the diploid moiety originates from the S. cerevisiae parent (Bond, 2009; Dunn and Sherlock, 2008). However, recent WGS analysis revealed that both Weihenstephan 34/70 (a Frohberg-type yeast) and CBS1513 (Unterhefe I, a Saaz-type yeast) are allotetraploid strains, both originating  from  a  diploid-diploid  rare  mating event between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus (Nakao et al., 2009; Walther et al., 2014). Interestingly, the two strains differed remarkably in the ratio in which both parental strains were retained in the genome: while Weihenstephan 34/70 harbours a tetraploid genome of 23.6Mb, with an approx. 1:1 ratio of both parental strains (36 different chromosome structures, 64 chromosomes in total), the genome of CBS1513 is much smaller (19.5Mb), and the S.  cerevisiae  parental  strain  is  underrepresented compared to S. eubayanus (allotriploid (3n-1) with 29 different chromosome structures, 47 chromo-somes in total). This interesting parental imbalance in the CBS1513 genome was shown to be caused by a large loss of the S. cerevisiae genome, includ-ing three complete S. cerevisiae chromosomes (VI, XI and XII). This is in line with previous findings based on PCR-RFLP (Rainieri et al., 2006) and array CGH (Dunn and Sherlock, 2008). Addition-ally, the CBS1513 genome was characterized by numerous large regions of loss of heterozygosity in  chromosomes  originating  from  S.  cerevisiae, resulting in homozygous sequences derived from the S. eubayanus parent. Indeed, it was shown that

approximately  1.44  Mb  of  S.  cerevisiae-derived DNA got replaced by its S. eubayanus complement on four different chromosomes (chromosome IV, XIII, XV and XVI), whereas the opposite was only true for 0.22 Mb.
More recently, Okuno et al. (2016) analysed in  more  detail  the  genetic  composition  of  ten lager yeasts (five Saaz type: CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, CBS1174, CBS2440 and five Frohberg type  W34/70,  CBS1483,  CBS1484,  CBS2156, CBS5832)   using   Illumina   next   generation-sequencing. The ploidy of the strains was estimated by mapping the obtained paired-end reads onto the genomes of both parental species. S. cerevisiae derived  chromosomes  in  Saaz-type  yeasts  were haploid or missing, whereas most S. eubayanus-derived chromosomes appeared to be diploid or triploid. Moreover, partial or whole deletions of S. cerevisiae derived chromosomes were observed frequently (e.g. deletions of the right arm of chro-mosome IV, left arm of chromosome XIII and the entire chromosome XII were common in all five sequenced  Saaz-type  lager  yeasts).  In  contrast, the genome of Frohberg type lager yeasts was composed of a haploid or diploid set of S. cerevi-siae derived chromosomes, whereas the ploidy of S. eubayanus derived chromosomes ranged from haploid to triploid. The observed chromosomal imbalance implied that the five Saaz type S. pasto-rianus strains, together with Frohberg type lager yeast CBS2156 can be regarded as being triploids, with a total genome size ranging from 14.4 Mb to 19.2 Mb and that Frohberg type lager yeasts (except for CBS2156) are tetraploids (Okuno et al., 2016). Analysis of the genome structure of S. pastorianus indicates a complex evolutionary history and allows inference on the origin of the new species.
Throughout  the  years,  there  has  been  some uncertainty  about  whether  both  S.  pastorianus archetypes originate from a single hybridization between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus, or if the Saaz-type and Frohberg-type lager yeasts are derived from   two   independent   hybridization   events. Based on the recent identification of three shared translocation  sites  (HSP82,  XRN1/KEM1,  and MAT) between the Weihenstephan 34/70 and the CBS1513 yeast, it was suggested that both types of lager yeasts share a joint history and a common ancestor, backing up previous work in which the close relationship between Weihenstephan 34/70
Genomics and Evolution of Beer Yeasts |  161


and  CBS1513  was  appointed  based  on  single gene analysis (Nguyen et al., 2011; Walther et al., 2014). More recent work rejected this hypothesis of a shared ancestor for both types of lager yeasts, and restored the hypothesis that the two lager yeast lineages  originate  from  two  separate  hybridiza-tion events (Monerawela et al., 2015). This study showed that the Frohberg strains originated from a stout-type yeast, while the S. cerevisiae moiety of the Saaz strains had the highest similarity with Foster O-like ale strains (an Australian ale yeast with Euro-pean roots).
However, the sequencing of ten lager yeasts by Okuno and coworkers identified novel shared interchromosomal translocations between S. cere-visiae-type and S. eubayanus-type genomes in both groups of lager yeasts, favouring the presence of at least one shared hybridization event (Okuno et al., 2016). For instance, this hypothesis was supported by the presence of two translocations in HSP82 and KEM1 loci, occurring in eight out of the 10 tested lager yeasts (for yeasts CBS1538 and CBS1174 the HSP82 locus got lost via a chromosomal deletion). In addition, the mtDNA of S. pastorianus showed some interesting trends. In a study on 22 different lager yeasts by RFLP analysis (using four different restriction enzymes), all lager yeasts tested showed a similar uniparental inheritance of the mtDNA of their non-cerevisiae parent (Rainieri et al., 2008). These findings were later confirmed in the work of Dunn and Sherlock (where none of the 17 tested lager yeasts seemed to contain S. cerevisiae-derived mtDNA; Dunn and Sherlock, 2008) and the WGS of Weihenstephan 34/70 (Nakao et al., 2009). This suggests that S. eubayanus mtDNA might harbour one or more genes that provide a competitive advantage for S. pastorianus in a lager beer environ-ment. This theory finds further support in the work of González and coworkers, who also observed a similar uniparental inheritance of mtDNA in natu-ral interspecific hybrids between S. cerevisiae and the cold-tolerant species S. bayanus and S. kudri-avzevii, discovered in European wine fermentation environments (González et al., 2006). However, the genes causing this trend are yet to be identified.

Phenotypic differences
The  two  lager  yeast  archetypes  were  originally described in 1909 (Lindner, 1909), but the first systematic phenotypic screening of these groups

was  only  published  recently  (Gibson  and  Liti, 2014; de Barros Lopes et al., 2002; Mertens et al., 2015; Walther et al., 2014). In these studies, several remarkable differences were revealed.
First, Saaz-type yeasts showed a higher growth capacity at 10°C than Frohberg-type yeasts, suggest-ing that Saaz-type yeasts harbour a higher tolerance towards cold temperatures (Gibson et al., 2013b; Walther et al., 2014). Second, Frohberg-type yeasts showed a faster fermentation profile and higher degree of attenuation in 22°P fermentation at 15°C (Gibson et al., 2013b), 14°P fermentation at 14°C (Walther et al., 2014), and 12°P fermentation at 16°C (Mertens et al., 2015). This remarkable difference was explained by the incapability of Saaz-type lager yeasts to eficiently metabolize maltotriose (Gibson et al., 2013b). Third, Saaz-type yeasts showed lower cell viability and formed more respiration-deficient ‘petite’ cells at the end of fermentation. These phenotypes are generally undesired in lager yeasts, since lager yeasts are traditionally reused for seven to twenty-one consecutive fermentation batches, and thus require high phenotypic stability. Finally, the aroma profile of both lager yeast archetypes also differed significantly. In general, Frohberg-type yeasts  produced  higher  concentrations  of  ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, and isoamyl alcohol, but less acetaldehyde (Gibson et al., 2013b; Mertens et al., 2015; Walther et al., 2014). These phenotypic differences may partly explain why Frohberg-type lager yeasts are generally preferred over Saaz-type lager yeasts in today’s beer industry.

Future prospects of lager yeasts
The earlier described limited genetic and pheno-typic  diversity  of  lager  yeasts  [especially  when compared to the immense genetic and aromatic diversity of ale S. cerevisiae yeast strains (Gallone et al., 2016; Steensels et al., 2014a)] has inspired sev-eral researchers to develop new and more diverse lager yeasts (for the most recent review, see Gibson and Liti, 2014). Moreover, the recent discovery and isolation of S. eubayanus lent the opportunity to develop new interspecific hybrids between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus in the lab, providing a powerful tool to generate strains with superior brewing properties (Hebly et al., 2015; Krogerus et al., 2015; Mertens et al., 2015). Indeed, the development of interspecific hybrids has proven to be an eficient approach to develop novel yeast

variants with enhanced characteristics for wine-and beer-making. Typically, an industrial strain of S. cerevisiae yeast is crossed with a wild, non-cerevisiae member of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex, such as S. bayanus (Marinoni et al., 1999; Sato et al., 2002; Sebastiani et al., 2002; Serra et al., 2005), S. kudriavzevii (Bellon et al., 2011; Pérez-Través et al., 2012), S. uvarum (Dunn et al., 2013; Piotrowski et al., 2012), S. mikatae (Bellon et al., 2013), or S. eubayanus (Hebly et al., 2015; Krogerus et al., 2015; Mertens et al., 2015). The first attempt to generate new lager yeasts was established through pair-wise mass mating of ale type S. cerevisiae yeasts and a S. bayanus yeast strain (for further description of mass mating and other breeding techniques, see Chapter 5). Resulting hybrids showed a higher fermentation capacity than both their respective parental strains, and some showed a similar fermentation capac-ity  to  their  control  bottom-fermenting  yeast, already highlighting the potential of newly formed interspecific  yeast  hybrids  for  lager  beer  brew-ing (Sato et al., 2002). More recently, two papers were published in which a similar, auxotrophic marker-assisted mass-mating strategy was used to generate four interspecific yeast hybrids between S. eubayanus type strain CBS12357 (wild isolate isolated in Patagonia; Libkind et al., 2011) and S. cerevisiae strains IMK439 (Hebly et al., 2015) or VTT-A81062 (Krogerus et al., 2015). The hybrids inherited interesting properties of both parental strains (cold tolerance, maltotriose utilization, and strong flocculation) and showed hybrid vigour for several traits, such as fermenting speed and fermen-tation capacity in lab-scale lager beer fermentation tests (Hebly et al., 2015; Krogerus et al., 2015). In a more elaborate study, a set of 31 novel interspe-cific yeast hybrids were developed, resulting from large-scale robot-assisted selection and breeding between six different S. cerevisiae and two different S. eubayanus strains, with the aim to increase the aromatic diversity in lager beers (Mertens et al., 2015). Many of these new hybrids produced an aromatic profile significantly different from those produced by currently available lager yeast in both lab and pilot scale fermentation tests, therefore pro-viding a source of lager yeasts able to produce new, aromatically diverse lager beers.

Brettanomyces bruxellensis – the locomotive of spontaneous beer fermentation
A yeast that received considerably less scientific attention compared to Saccharomyces, but which is strongly linked with the production process of specific beer styles, is B. bruxellensis. While the vast majority of beers are brewed by pure starter cultures of S. cerevisiae or S. pastorianus yeasts (see above), this species plays a key role in beer fermentation processes relying on a natural inoculum, such as the American Coolship Ales (Bokulich et al., 2012) and the lambic and gueuze beers produced in the surroundings of Brussels, Belgium (Bokulich et al., 2013; Martens, 1997). In these complex microbial matrices, Brettanomyces lives in perfect harmony with various other microbial groups, such as lactic acid bacteria, and accounts for many of the typical organoleptic characteristics of the beer. Moreover, the incredible potential and unique aromatic prop-erties of this species are increasingly recognized, with more and more artisans adding it deliberately to their fermentations, either as a pure culture or in combination with more traditional brewing strains (see Chapter 7).
Interestingly, Brettanomyces yeasts were amongst the first yeasts ever to be isolated and described in detail. The etymological origin of the Brettanomyces genus lies in Great Britain, where it was first iso-lated in 1904 by Niels Hjelte Claussen, a younger colleague of the famous Emile Christian Hansen at the Carlsberg brewery. He retrieved the yeasts from strong English stock ales, and was inspired by this niche when naming his new discovery (Bret-tano=British,  Myces=fungus).  Claussen  quickly recognized the peculiar flavour characteristics of these yeasts compared to more conventional Sac-charomyces  strains,  and  therefore  protected  the application of Brettanomyces in beer fermentations with a patent (UK patent GB190328184). Interest-ingly, this is the first patented microorganism in history.
One century later, however, the role of Bret-tanomyces in the food industry is confounded and ambiguous. While their presence is still imperative in some (mainly spontaneously fermented) beers, they are considered to be some of the worst spoilage microbes in wine, mostly due to their typical aroma

profile, which can be described as ‘burnt plastic’, ‘barnyard’, ‘horse sweat’, and ‘leather’ [also referred to as the co-called ‘Brett character’ (Licker et al., 1999; Wedral et al., 2010)]. Mainly driven by their role as a villain in wine production, several research groups adopted this yeast for a more in-depth study. The  advent  of  next-generation  sequencing  (see above) recently provided these researchers with the tools necessary for the in-depth analysis of Brettan-omyces (population) genomics, yielding fascinating data on the genomic build-up of this evolutionarily intriguing yeast. In this section, we will provide a concise overview of the current knowledge of the Brettanomyces genomics, evolution, and population structure. More elaborate studies on this yeast are given elsewhere (Crauwels et al., 2015a; Curtin and Pretorius, 2014; Schifferdecker et al., 2014; Steen-sels et al., 2015).

Brettanomyces taxonomy and phylogeny
Over the years, a plethora of different Brettanomy-ces species were suggested and the names of these species were freely used in scientific publications. However,  Brettanomyces  taxonomy  has  changed regularly in the past decades and there have been many reclassifications over the years, making direct comparisons between old and more recent papers often challenging. A first attempt to describe the Brettanomyces  genus  comprehensively  was  per-formed by Mathieu Custers in 1940. He defined a classification based on a few asexually reproducing (anamorphic) variants (Custers, 1940; Wijsman et al., 1984). A few decades later, in 1960, the forma-tion of ascospores was observed in some strains and the genus Dekkera was introduced in the taxonomy as the teleomorphic (sexual) counterpart of Bret-tanomyces. In the first edition of their manual on yeast characteristics and identification, Barnett and co-workers described the following 9 Brettanomy-ces and Dekkera species: Brettanomyces abstinens, Brettanomyces  anomalus,  Brettanomyces  claussenii, Brettanomyces custersianus, Brettanomyces custersii, Brettanomyces lambicus, Brettanomyces naardenensis, Dekkera bruxellensis and Dekkera intermedia (Bar-nett et al., 1983). Today, five species are formally described,  based  on  molecular  analysis  of  the genera: the anamorphs B. bruxellensis, B. anomalus,

B. custersianus, B. naardenensis, and Brettanomyces nanus, with teleomorphs existing for the first two species, D. bruxellensis and D. anomala. However, according to the recent guidelines of the Interna-tional Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (the Melbourne Code), fungal species should be assigned only a single valid name. Since the name Brettanomyces is well-known and used more commonly in the food and beverage industries, it will likely be prioritized over Dekkera (Daniel et al., 2014). Moreover, after the first description of spore formation, spores have not been reported again (Schifferdecker et al., 2014), suggesting the teleomorphic state is very rare (see further).
Despite  that  Brettanomyces  spp.  have  several traits in common with S. cerevisiae, these two genera are genetically only distantly related (Kurtzman and Robnett, 2013). Research papers focusing on the phylogeny of B. bruxellensis and related species remain scarce, but it is shown that Brettanomyces is part of a phylogenetic clade comprising methy-lotrophic yeast species of the genus Ogataea, such as Ogataea angusta, Ogataea glucozyma, Ogataea parapolymorpha, and Ogataea polymorpha, as well as other methylotrophs such as Kuraishia capsu-lata, Candida boidinii, and Komagetaella pastoris (previously Pichia pastoris), although the inclusion of the latter species in this clade is uncertain. This clade  seems  to  have  diverged  from  the  ‘CTG-clade’ (containing, for example, Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Scheffersomyces stipitis) progenitor after sharing a common ancestor with S. cerevisiae. Using these phylogenetic relationships, it was calculated that B. bruxellensis and S. cerevisiae separated roughly estimated 200 million years ago (Rozpędowska et al., 2011). Nevertheless, both species share several interesting traits. For example, they  have  independently  acquired  resistance  to high ethanol concentrations, as well as the ability to produce ethanol even in the presence of oxygen (the Crabtree effect, see earlier section, ‘Natural selection  shaped  the  Saccharomyces  genome’), which enables both species to thrive in alcoholic fermentation processes (see further). This is a clear example of parallel evolution, since these traits arose independently in different lineages that share a similar niche (Rozpędowska et al., 2011).

A first glimpse at the peculiar genome and population structure of Brettanomyces bruxellensis
To date, genome assemblies of six B. bruxellensis strains have been published, with several more on the way. Five of these six strains originate from the wine industry (Borneman et al., 2014; Curtin et al., 2012; Piškur et al., 2012; Valdes et al., 2014; Woolfit et al., 2007), while one was isolated from lambic beer (Crauwels et al., 2014). In 2007, Woolfit and coworkers published the first exploratory genome survey of the French wine spoilage strain CBS2499, providing a first glimpse of the surprising features of the B. bruxellensis genome (Woolfit et al., 2007). Initially, CBS2499 was believed to be haploid, but this was quickly debunked by a follow-up study in which a more in-depth de-novo assembly was performed, showing that the strain was actually diploid  (Piškur  et  al.,  2012).  This  latter  study described a total assembly size of 13.4Mb and was able to identify 5600 genes, from which 75% could be functionally annotated. Around the same time, a second strain was sequenced (AWRI 1499), yielding a 12.7-Mb assembly and 4969 predicted genes (Curtin et al., 2012). ST05.12/22, the only non-wine isolate sequenced to date, was shown to be 13.0Mbp and 5255 genes were predicted (Crau-wels et al., 2014). Recently, the first South American isolate was sequenced (Valdes et al., 2014), and Borneman and coworkers published an in-depth genomic comparison of four wine isolates: the previously sequenced AWRI 1499 and CBS2499 and two newly sequenced strains, AWRI 1608 and AWRI 1613 (Borneman et al., 2014). Analysis of the sequences revealed some interesting similarities of, but also peculiar differences between, the differ-ent strains.
First, it was shown that the ploidy of B. bruxel-lensis is variable: while CBS2499, AWRI 1613, and ST05.12/22 were shown to be diploid, haplotyping analysis revealed that AWRI 1499 and AWRI 1608 consist of two moderately heterozygous sets of chromosomes (a core, diploid fraction) and a third haploid set that is divergent (Borneman et al., 2014; Crauwels et al., 2014). Fascinatingly, the variable haploid fraction was shown to be phylogenetically distant,  suggesting  that  multiple  independent hybridization events were involved in the emer-gence of these allotriploids. It is not yet clear if the

divergent haploid set originates from a separate spe-cies or distantly related B. bruxellensis strains.
Second, it was shown that the karyotype varies drastically  from  strain  to  strain  (Hellborg  and Piškur, 2009). B. bruxellensis strains can contain between four and nine chromosomes, and the size of these chromosomes can range from 1 to 6Mbp. This is peculiar, since chromosome configuration is usually well preserved among populations belong-ing to the same species; for example, different strains of S. cerevisiae are collinear and consist of 16 chromosomes. However, since newly formed hybrid genomes tend to be very unstable (as often shown for Saccharomyces hybrids; Antunovics et al., 2005; Dunn et al., 2013; Piotrowski et al., 2012), mechanisms that drive genome stabilization could at least explain some of the extreme karyotype variability observed. Additionally, the karyotype variability could suggest that B. bruxellensis might employ frequent variations in chromosome struc-ture  to  increase  their  genome  variability  and competitiveness.   However,   although   genomic mutability is beneficial for the adaptability of the species, it can impede sexual reproduction and drive speciation (Fischer et al., 2000). This could explain the absence (or very low frequency) of sexual reproduction in B. bruxellensis (see further).
Third,  even  though  Brettanomyces  did  not undergo  a  whole  genome  duplication  (WGD) event, many localized duplications (CNVs)] and even opposing copy number changes in the same region between strains, were observed (Borneman et al., 2014; Crauwels et al., 2014, 2015b). Since gene duplication is a major source of new genes, it is a central factor influencing genome evolution (Ohno, 1970; Wolfe and Li, 2003). The observed CNVs were frequent in subtelomeric regions and often included genes involved in nutrient (sugar) metabolism, indicating that they might affect uti-lization of specific carbon sources (Borneman et al., 2014). However, a more in-depth study on the paralogues is required to draw strong conclusion.

Brettanomyces is a well-adapted fermentation scavenger
The occurrence of Brettanomyces in natural habitats is only sporadically described (Renouf and Lon-vaud-Funel, 2007), but it has been shown that they frequently colonize man-made ecological niches,
Genomics and Evolution of Beer Yeasts |  165


such as alcoholic fermentation processes (wine, beer, bioethanol, cider, etc.), soft drinks, dairy prod-ucts, kombucha, and sourdough (Crauwels et al., 2015a; Steensels et al., 2015). A common thread in these niches is the presence of harsh environmental conditions that are lethal for many microbes: high ethanol concentrations, low pH, the absence of readily fermentable nitrogen and carbon sources, low oxygen, etc. While resistance to these stressors is not uncommon in microbes, there are few species that combine all of these traits, thus withstanding such challenging environments. In this section, we will further elaborate on how Brettanomyces evolved to become such a highly specialized fermentation organism and how it has acquired different mecha-nisms to outcompete, or rather outlive, its main fungal competitor in alcoholic fermentations, S. cerevisiae.
Comparative  analysis  of  the  B.  bruxellensis genomes revealed some interesting properties that could be linked to their behaviour and ecological niches. First, similar to S. cerevisiae, B. bruxellensis seems to have evolved a mechanism that allows them to accumulate and be highly tolerant to high con-centrations of a toxic metabolite (ethanol), even in the presence of oxygen, a strategy that heavily con-tributes to their dominance over ethanol-sensitive microbes in sugar-rich environments, and is called the ‘make-accumulate-consume’ strategy (Piškur et al., 2006). Recently, a study performed by Rozpe-dowska and coworkers (2011) deciphered how B. bruxellensis has evolved this phenotype similarly to, but independently of, Saccharomyces yeasts: both lineages used the same strategy relying on global promoter rewiring to change the expression pat-tern of respiration-associated genes. Interestingly, B. bruxellensis seems to have evolved an additional strategy to outcompete other microbes. Besides ethanol, they are also capable of producing, accu-mulating, and later consuming acetic acid in aerobic conditions, and withstand the resulting low-pH environment. The (lineage-specific) duplication of oxidoreductase genes might explain the capacity to produce acetate under aerobic conditions (Curtin et al., 2012; Piškur et al., 2012). It is important to note, however, that not all Brettanomyces species share this trait. For example, B. naardenensis, which separated approximately 100 million years ago from B. bruxellensis, is unable to grow in the absence of  oxygen  and  their  metabolism  is  completely

respiratory (and thus no ethanol or acetic acid is formed), indicating that they are Crabtree-negative (Rozpędowska et al., 2011).
Second,  it  was  shown  that  B.  bruxellensis  is well-equipped to withstand nutrient-poor environ-ments. For example, many B. bruxellensis strains are equipped with a gene cluster containing a nitrate transporter, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, and two Zn(II)2 Cys6-type transcription factors, which enables the utilization of nitrate as a sole nitrogen source (Borneman et al., 2014; Crauwels et al., 2014, 2015b; Woolfit et al., 2007). This trait might provide an important fitness advantage over other species, such as S. cerevisiae (typically unable to utilize nitrate), in low-nitrogen environments like molasses, soft drinks, or late stages of beer and wine fermentations.  Additionally,  B.  bruxellensis  lacks (or only shows very limited) glycerol 3-phosphate phosphatase activity, resulting in no (or very low) glycerol production (Tiukova et al., 2013; Wijsman et al., 1984). This trait can be disadvantageous in certain conditions (e.g. it reduces growth speed in environments deprived from oxygen, since glycerol is an important factor in maintaining the redox bal-ance in anaerobiosis), but it provides a competitive advantage  over  S.  cerevisiae  in  nutrient-limiting environments (where energy eficiency is pivotal), since glycerol production is an energy-consuming process. All these adaptations to harsh, nutrient-limiting  environments  support  the  scavenging lifestyle of B. bruxellensis.
Third, gene content analysis revealed a relative enrichment in cell membrane-related genes com-pared with two genetically closely related species (Pichia angusta and Komagetaella pastoris) and S. cerevisiae (Curtin et al., 2012). Interestingly, many of the enriched membrane-related genes (e.g. FIG2, FLO1, FLO5, FLO9, HKR1, and MUC1) might be advantageous for survival in wine or beer matured in oak barrels, where they could mediate the adhe-sion of the cells to the internal wall of the barrel and protect them from washing out during high-pres-sure cleaning (Christiaens et al., 2012; Verstrepen and Klis, 2006).
Finally, B. bruxellensis shows some interesting trends  in  carbon-source  utilization,  which  can sometimes  even  be  variable  amongst  different isolates (see further). Compared to S. cerevisiae, the genome of B. bruxellensis shows a significant enrichment   for   membrane-associated   nutrient

transporters and genes involved in the metabo-lism of alternative carbon sources (such as chitin, N-acetylglucosamine,   galactose,   mannose,   and lactose) (Curtin et al., 2012; Woolfit et al., 2007). Moreover, it shows very eficient sucrose utilization, accounted for by the expression of a high-eficiency sucrose transporter for which no homologues exist in S. cerevisiae. This trait might be key for the high competitiveness of B. bruxellensis in sucrose-based fermentations such as certain types of molasses (De Barros Pita et al., 2011; Tiukova et al., 2013). Additionally, B. bruxellensis shows a higher afinity for glucose in carbon-limiting conditions, possibly mediated by an orthologue of the Candida albicans HGT1 gene, encoding a high-afinity H+-symport glucose transporter (Leite et al., 2013).
In short, the behaviour of B. bruxellensis shows strong  similarities  with  Saccharomyces  species, which is reflected in the numerous niches that they  share.  However,  B.  bruxellensis  seems  to have evolved an extensive specialization in more

challenging conditions, which are for example cre-ated during the course of beverage fermentation processes.

Intraspecific Brettanomyces bruxellensis variability: adaptations to wine and beer environment?
Genetic diversity studies using classic DNA fin-gerprinting  techniques  have  revealed  significant genotypic intraspecific variability of B. bruxellensis (Fig. 6.3) (Conterno et al., 2006; Crauwels et al., 2014; Martorell et al., 2006; Miot-Sertier and Lon-vaud-Funel, 2007; Mitrakul et al., 1999; Vigentini et al., 2012). Moreover, much like in S. cerevisiae, some of these studies reported a correlation between genotype groups of B. bruxellensis and their source of isolation (e.g. beer or wine) (Conterno et al., 2006; Crauwels et al., 2014; Vigentini et al., 2012), suggesting niche adaptation. Furthermore, recently, this correlation was also established for B. bruxellen-sis phenotypes (Crauwels et al., 2015b). In this latter

study,  the  authors  performed  high-throughput phenotyping experiments (using Biolog Phenotype Microarrays), and identified several consistent dif-ferences between strains from different origins, such as wine and beer fermentations. For example, the ability to assimilate particular α- and β-glycosides as well as α- and β-substituted monosaccharides was shown to be highly variable amongst isolates, but consistent within strains from the same origin. While strains isolated from wine were able to utilize d-galactose, this is not the case for beer isolates. Coinciding with these observations, strains unable to grow on galactose were found to lack at least one of the genes involved in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. Further, brewing strains are, in contrast to wine strains, not capable of using the β-glycoside disaccharides cellobiose and gentio-biose as well as the β-substituted monosaccharides β-methyl-glucoside and arbutine, suggesting that these strains lack the enzyme(s) responsible for the breakage of specific β-bonded sugars. Indeed, WGS revealed that while wine strains contain two (distinct) β-glucosidase genes, beer strains lack one of these genes (Crauwels et al., 2015b). Inter-estingly, these β-glucosidases are industrially very relevant, since they also play an important role in flavour development of beer and wine (Daenen et al., 2004). They enable the hydrolysis of locked, gly-cosidically bound flavour compounds and can thus enrich the flavour profile of these fermented bever-ages (Pogorzelski and Wilkowska, 2007). However, further research is needed to investigate the exact role of these β-glucosidases in flavouring capability of B. bruxellensis strains.
Interestingly,   the   genes   involved   in   the Leloir pathway as well as the above-mentioned β-glucosidase genes are clustered in a ≈36kb region encompassing 13 genes, the majority of which are involved in carbon metabolism. This region was found to be completely absent in the beer strain ST05/12.22 (Crauwels et al., 2014). Moreover, a more thorough investigation revealed that this cluster has been gradually lost over time in beer strains: some lack only a few genes, other lack all 13 genes, but all beer strains lack the β-glucosidase gene. In contrast, this cluster of genes was entirely present in wine strains (at least in eight of the nine  studied  strains)  (Table  6.3)  (Crauwels  et al., 2015b). Interestingly, this genomic region is also  prone  to  CNVs  and  loss-of-heterozygosity

(Crauwels et al., 2015b). Based on these findings, it may be speculated that this gene cluster carries a fitness cost (e.g. a metabolic burden) for B. bruxel-lensis in certain fermentation systems such as beer brewing, thereby providing a selective pressure for its loss. These observations are reminiscent of the concerted loss of the galactose catabolism cluster in Japanese Saccharomyces kudriavzevii isolates com-pared to European isolates (Hittinger et al., 2010). However, further research is required to draw firm conclusions.
Despite the increasing knowledge about these genetic   and   phenotypic   differences   between B. bruxellensis strains, only little is known about the behavior of different B. bruxellensis strains in differ-ent ecological niches. Recent research by Crauwels et al. (2016) has shown that sugar consumption and aroma production are determined by both the yeast strain and the composition of the medium. Furthermore, this study reinforces the hypothesis of niche adaptation of B. bruxellensis, most clearly for wine strains. For example, only strains originally isolated from wine were able to thrive well and produce the typical Brettanomyces-related phenolic off-flavors 4-ethylguaiacol and 4-ethylphenol when inoculated in red wine. Sulfite tolerance was found as a key factor explaining the observed differences in fermentation performance and off-flavor produc-tion.
It is also interesting to note the possibility that the ploidy level may be linked to the yeast’s ecologi-cal niche. More particularly, triploidy seems to be predominant in the Australian B. bruxellensis popu-lation, since it is observed in 92% of all isolates from Australian wines (Borneman et al., 2014; Curtin et al., 2007). Moreover, microsatellite typing hints towards the existence of similar populations in French and South African wine isolates (Albertin et al., 2014). In contrast, the majority of B. bruxel-lensis beer strains are found to be diploid (Crauwels et al., 2015b). This interesting allotriploid genome structure is not rare in fungi and is evocative of the interspecific hybrids identified in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto clade, such as the lager yeast S. pasto-rianus and the S. cerevisiae/S. kudriavzevii hybrids isolated  from  wine  and  ale  beer  fermentations (González et al., 2006, 2008). In the case of Saccha-romyces hybrids, it was suggested that the additional set of chromosomes confers a selective advantage in an industrial environment (see above), but it

remains to be determined whether similar evolu-tionary driving forces are at play in the allotriploid B. bruxellensis strains. It was suggested that the abil-ity of wine strains to withstand high levels of sulfite, the main antimicrobial agent in wine fermentations, might be at least partially explained by the triploidy state (Borneman et al., 2014; Curtin et al., 2012), but further research is required.

Brettanomyces genomics: catching up with Saccharomyces
All in all, our knowledge of Brettanomyces is still very limited compared with the vast number of data available for S. cerevisiae, the model fungus par excellence. However, several research groups currently are trying to bridge this gap and unravel the peculiar genomic properties of this industrially highly relevant yeast. However, several important challenges remain.
First,  despite  the  fact  that  some  research groups  reported  ascospore  formation  (albeit  at low  frequency)  of  B.  bruxellensis  (e.g.  CBS74 and CBS4914; Van der Walt et al., 1964) and B. anomalus (e.g. CBS8139; Th. Smith and van Grinsven, 1984) strains, it still remains unclear to what  extent  Brettanomyces  can  reproduce  sexu-ally, how often this occurs, and what the influence of these events is on the evolution of the species. The extreme karyotypic variability and frequently observed allotriploidy might hint towards the lack (or at least the rarity) of sexual reproduction. In line with this theory, an extensive genetic investigation of the Brettanomyces population within a winery (spanning several vintages) revealed that the same persistent  clonal  Brettanomyces  population  was responsible for wine spoilage in this winery for over half a century (Albertin et al., 2014).
Second,  the  genetic  and  molecular  toolbox for Brettanomyces should be expanded in order to facilitate more in-depth genetic analysis. For example, an optimal transformation protocol is still lacking, auxotrophic mutants are scarce, and only a limited amount of dedicated commercial tools, such as plasmid vectors or gene arrays, are available (Schifferdecker et al., 2014). However, some initial attempts to develop molecular tools and protocols were conducted. Miklenić and coworkers devel-oped various transformation protocols (based on spheroplast transformation, electroporation, and the LiAc/PEG method) and described the first (reported) genetic transformation of B. bruxellensis,

using  a  kanMX4  marker  cassette  that  allowed for selection on agar plates containing geneticin (Miklenić et al., 2013). Additionally, Schifferdecker and colleagues developed a URA3-deficient mutant strain and a plasmid (named P892, derived from pUC57) containing a functional URA3 gene of CBS2499  (Schifferdecker  et  al.,  2014).  Using these tools, an auxotrophic transformation system and an expression vector was developed, allowing overexpression of individual genes with a constitu-tive TEF1 promoter (Schifferdecker et al., 2016). While commercial microarray kits for Brettanomy-ces are still lacking, a first large-scale transcriptomic analysis of B. bruxellensis was recently performed (Tiukova et al., 2013). Using whole transcriptome sequencing, the authors managed to detect the expression of 3715 out of the 4861 annotated genes of CBS11270, and the results elucidated survival strategies  of  this  yeast  in  harsh  environments. For example, they observed a low expression of genes involved in glycerol production and a high number of expressed sugar transporter genes, two mechanisms possibly accounting for the high com-petitiveness of B. bruxellensis in oxygen-limited and nutrient-deprived environments (Tiukova  et  al., 2013).
Third, to fully grasp the Brettanomyces popula-tion structure and evolutionary history, analysis of a broader collection of ecologically and geographi-cally diverse strains is necessary. While the main focus thus far is put on wine spoilers (mainly origi-nating from Australia), preliminary investigation of strains from different niches and geographical ori-gins already revealed a large degree of intraspecific (phenotypic and genetic) diversity, and sometimes revealed links between phenotypic behaviour and source of isolation (Crauwels et al., 2014, 2015b). While some of these correlations might be due to genetic drift and shared population histories of strains originating from the same environment, some might reflect adaptive mechanisms devel-oped in industrial niches. However, more elaborate studies, targeting the genetic and phenotypic char-acterization of large collections of diverse strains, will yield more information on some fundamental questions, and shed light on the currently obscure Brettanomyces evolutionary history. For example, it will be interesting to see if (and to what extent) Brettanomyces is domesticated, and how the Bret-tanomyces population is structured.

Conclusions
With their small and compact genome, short rep-lication time and easy handling in the lab, yeasts pose the ultimate model organism for genetics and population genomics. However, surprisingly, the number of sequenced yeast strains currently avail-able is still limited, especially compared to other eukaryotic model organisms, such as the fruit fly, Arabidopsis thaliana and humans, which have more complex  and  much  larger  genomes  (Peter  and Schacherer, 2016). However, current technological developments provide the opportunity to obtain whole-genome sequences for just a few 100 dol-lars, resulting in a recent burst of yeast genomics data (Almeida et al., 2014, 2015; Borneman et al., 2011, 2014, 2016; Gallone et al., 2016; Jeffares et al., 2015; Okuno et al., 2016; Strope et al., 2015). While these studies reveal crucial aspects of yeast evolution and domestication, they only cover the tip of the iceberg of yeast biodiversity. Therefore, future  studies  that  include  a  larger  number  of yeast strains (including non-cerevisiae species such as B. bruxellensis), will further elucidate the evo-lutionary path these yeasts went through during their association with human-made fermentation environments.  Furthermore,  these  studies  will give valuable insights in genotype–phenotype asso-ciations, providing opportunities for targeted strain improvement strategies, such as marker-assisted breeding.

Abstract
Traditional beer fermentations do not apply inocu-lation of pure cultures to initiate the fermentation process.  In  contrast,  they  rely  on  spontaneous inoculation,  ‘backslopping’,  or  inoculation  with an undetermined mixture of microorganisms for the production of the beer. Knowledge about the microbiota responsible for these special fermenta-tion processes does not only enable a closer quality management, but the isolation of the microorgan-isms involved enables their application as starter cultures. Very commonly, the same microorgan-isms are involved in these processes, i.e. the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and/or Saccharomyces pas-torianus plus Brettanomyces (Dekkera) bruxellensis, lactic acid bacteria and/or acetic acid bacteria. All traditional beers share a desirable tartness and their production processes take from several days to sev-eral years to complete. This chapter reviews notable types of traditional beer fermentations, their micro-bial ecology, and methods used to investigate their composition.


Introduction to traditional and mixed-culture beer fermentations
Beer is among the oldest fermented beverages and is the product of a fermented sugar extract from

grains. Historically, beers were the result of spon-taneous fermentations, involving several yeasts and bacteria. Conversely, pure yeast cultures have been commonly used in most modern breweries ever since they were first proposed by Hansen (Claus-sen,  1904).  Most  commercial  beer  brands  are produced using proprietary Saccharomyces cerevi-siae or Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces bayanus strains for the production of ales and lagers, respectively. The resulting beers have a standardized batch-to-batch flavour and are appreciated by beer lovers around the world. The presence of wild-type yeasts  and/or  bacteria  during  the  fermentation process or in the final beer can alter the flavour and physical characteristics of the beers, turning them unsellable. The economic losses related to these problems are a threat in commercial breweries worldwide, emphasizing the need for quality con-trol of the final beers prior to their shipping to the customers.
In contrast to modern commercial ale and lager brands,  some  traditional  beers  do  not  require axenic yeast cultures to pitch their worts and some breweries do not even inoculate the wort to induce the fermentation of their beers. These products are thought to resemble ancient beers, since they involve both bacteria and yeasts and have a vinous acidic character. Two major types of such beers are brewed in Belgium. For the production of lambic

and gueuze beers, no yeast or bacteria are pitched to start the fermentation, whereas red-brown acidic ales re-pitch a lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-harbour-ing yeast suspension, that is harvested after every fermentation. Nowadays, there are traditional beers brewed outside Belgium that also apply mixed fer-mentations, either by spontaneous inoculation or through the use of mixed starter cultures. Lambic beers in particular and spontaneously fermented beers in general are currently highly appreciated all over the world, since they are trademarks of traditional  craftsmanship.  Traditionally,  Belgian lambic beers were produced in the Senne river valley (south-west of Brussels) and in the southeast of Brussels, but due to their growing popularity lambic-type beers are now produced elsewhere in Belgium and internationally.


The use of culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques in microbial biodiversity studies
While the microbiota of some traditional beers had been characterized with classical methods several decades ago, more recent microbial biodiversity studies have been performed using culture-inde-pendent community fingerprinting techniques in combination with traditional cultivation methods (Dolci et al., 2010; Laureys and De Vuyst, 2014; Scheirlinck et al., 2008; Van der Meulen et al., 2007; Wouters et al., 2013). Some of these stud-ies  have  focused  on  specific  microbial  groups of those communities, e.g. LAB or yeasts, while others address the entire community (Martens et al., 1991; Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991; Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserent-ant, 1995). In recent years, more advanced and high-throughput   culture-independent   methods, such  as  bar-coded  amplicon  sequencing  (BAS) and shotgun metagenomics, are rapidly replacing community fingerprinting methods such as dena-turing  gradient  gel  electrophoresis  (DGGE)  of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gene amplicons. The data obtained are considered superior to cul-ture-dependent data. Indeed, methods that involve cultivation of microorganisms are often considered less informative, as some microorganisms can be present in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC)

state, while isolation media favour the cultivation of specific microorganisms only (Gorski, 2012; Millet   and   Lonvaud-Funel,   2000).   Moreover, metagenomic  techniques  are  also  superior  to classical   fingerprint-based   culture-independent techniques such as PCR-DGGE, because of their ability to detect low-abundance species in the com-munities (Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013).
However, culture-independent techniques also introduce biases, for instance through differences in DNA extraction eficacy or in PCR-based ampli-fication of target sequences (Hong et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2012), and potentially detect not only metabolically inactive but also dead cells. There-fore, although these modern culture-independent approaches provide a more in-depth analysis of the microbial communities, they are not without limitations and also do not reveal which species are metabolically most active. Other tools, not only transcriptomics or meta-metabolomics but also the availability of pure cultures of community members will be required to reveal a more com-plete image of the microbial diversity present in an ecosystem.
Ironically, the potential to examine microbial ecosystems by means of modern metagenomics approaches triggered a renewed interest in the devel-opment of new approaches to cultivate a larger fraction of microorganisms that are known through the detection of their DNA only (Nature Reviews: Microbiology Editorial, 2013; Rappé, 2013; Teske, 2010). Based on metagenomics information about the genes and metabolic potential present, new culture media have been developed that target the isolation of specific microbial groups (Bomar et al., 2011). An approach referred to as culturomics (Lagier et al., 2012) is currently gaining momen-tum  in  the  field  of  gut  microbiome  research. Culturomics  refers  to  the  high-throughput  and miniaturized  application  of  numerous  classical media for the isolation of microorganisms and is limited only by the rate of identification of the isolates obtained. For this purpose, sequence-based identification methods are too slow and expensive but  matrix-assisted  laser  desorption/ionization time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF MS) has been advocated as an ideal identification technique  in  culturomics  approaches  to  study microbial diversity (Lagier et al., 2012).

Ecology of lambic beers produced in traditional and industrial lambic beer breweries

The traditional lambic beer fermentation process
Acidic  lambic  beers,  obtained  by  spontaneous fermentation, are probably the oldest known beers (De Keersmaecker, 1996). They are the products of a mixed fermentation that can last up to 3 years and are traditionally fermented in wooden casks (Ver-achtert and Iserentant, 1995). Notwithstanding the increasing popularity of lambic beers, the fermenta-tion process was dealt with only in some detail in studies performed between 1976 and 1995 by the research group of Professor-Emeritus Hubert Ver-achtert (Martens et al., 1991, 1992; Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991; Spaepen et al., 1978, 1979; Van Oevelen et al., 1976, 1977; Verachtert and Iser-entant, 1995). These studies were performed using biochemical methods solely and were limited in the number of isolates examined and in the taxonomi-cal information obtained (Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). Since the publica-tion of these early studies, the taxonomy of bacteria and yeasts involved in the lambic beer fermentation process underwent several changes and biochemi-cal identification methods were shown inadequate to reliably identify these microorganisms (Cleen-werck et al., 2008; De Bruyne et al., 2008; Kämpfer and Glaeser, 2012; Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998; Nhung et al., 2007). More recently, the microbial composition of these beers was updated with the current taxonomic knowledge and by the use of more advanced identification techniques (Spitaels et al., 2014c, 2015b).
Lambic beer is traditionally brewed during the cold winter months only, i.e. from October until March, because the lambic wort has to be cooled to approximately 20°C within the timeframe of one night. Lambic beer is traditionally produced using about 66% malted barley and 33% unmalted wheat. The use of at least 30% unmalted wheat in the mash is regulated by Belgian law. Traditionally, the lambic wort production starts with a turbid mash  method,  which  is  a  combination  of  the English infusion and German decoction processes (Fig. 7.1). Hot water is added during the English infusion process to increase the temperature of the mash. During decoction, the brewer boils a part of

the mash separately to rupture the starch granules and subsequently reintroduces it into the mash tun to increase the total mash temperature, ensuring the rests at the enzymes’ optimal temperatures (Briggs et al., 2004). During turbid mashing, the brewer does not reintroduce the separately boiled wort (called slime) into the mash tun, so that not all of the wort passes through all temperature rests (Fig. 7.1). The use of unmalted wheat and the turbid mashing step with separate slime cooking results in a wort that is rich in malto-oligosaccharides or dextrins. These dextrins are non-fermentable by conventional Saccharomyces brewing yeasts (Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991), but they can be fermented by Brettanomyces (the sporulating form of this yeast is named Dekkera) yeasts that are also present during the maturation of red-brown acidic ales of south-west Flanders (Martens et al., 1997). The wort is boiled for 3h, which is a long period compared with other beer types, and a large amount of aged hops is added to enhance the microbiologi-cal stability of the beer without resulting in a bitter hop flavour (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005; Vriesekoop et al., 2012). After wort cooking, the wort is cooled in an open vessel, called the cooling tun or coolship, which is mostly located in the attic of the brewery (Fig. 7.1). After overnight cooling in the coolship, the wort becomes exposed to the envi-ronmental microbiota that initiate fermentation. As lambic beers were originally only produced in the Senne river valley (southwest of Brussels) and in the southeast of Brussels, it was believed that the responsible microbiota were present in the air of this region (Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995).
The first reports of the microbiota and their metabolites divided the lambic beer fermentation process  into  four  phases:  the  Enterobacteriaceae phase, the main fermentation phase, the acidifica-tion phase, and the maturation phase; more recent studies  considered  the  acidification  phase  and maturation stage as a single period (Spitaels et al., 2014c; Van Oevelen et al., 1976, 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). Each phase was character-ized by the presence of specific microorganisms and metabolites (Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). The culture media used were selected based on previous studies and the observa-tion of increased concentrations of acetic acid and lactic acid, indicating the presence of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) and LAB (Van Oevelen et al., 1976).

Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from the cooled wort in the cooling tun and the cask (Martens et al., 1991; Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). The Enterobacteriaceae phase was reported to start after 3–7 days of fermentation, when bacterial counts reached up to 108 CFU/ml, to proceed for 30 to 40 days, and to be characterized by Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Klebsiella aerogenes) (Brisse et al., 2006) as the predominantly isolated Enterobacteriaceae species (Martens et al., 1991). Enterobacter aerogenes, Cit-robacter freundii, Escherichia coli and Hafnia alvei were additionally isolated (Martens et al., 1991). The number of Enterobacteriaceae cells present in brewery air is however low, and it has been hypoth-esized that wort inoculation during cooling is not homogeneous and bacteria are probably adsorbed to particles present in the air (Martens et al., 1991). Oxidative yeasts, such as the cycloheximide-resistant Hanseniaspora uvarum [its asexual form is named Kloeckera apiculata (Meyer et al., 1978)] and Naumovia dairensis (previously known as Sac-charomyces  dairensis) (Kurtzman, 2003) as well as  Saccharomyces  uvarum  [previously  known  as S. globosus (Nguyen and Gaillardin, 2005)] are the main yeast species present during the entero-bacterial phase of the lambic beer fermentation process (Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). H. uvarum has a low fermentative capacity and is commonly found during the sponta-neous fermentation of wines and ciders, where its contribution to flavour complexity is increasingly appreciated (Bezerra-Bussoli et al., 2013). Similar to B. bruxellensis, H. uvarum is capable of produc-ing ethyl esters, and was long considered as a wine spoilage yeast (Moreira et al., 2011; Romano et al., 2003). During this phase, the pH dropped one value, and considerable levels of butanediol and dimethyl sulfide were formed, along with formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, and ethanol (Verach-tert and Iserentant, 1995). The disappearance of the Enterobacteriaceae after about one month of fermentation is explained by the depletion of glu-cose, the increase in ethanol concentration and the
decreased pH of the wort (Martens et al., 1991).
A similar start of the lambic beer fermentation was found during a more recent study of a tradi-tional lambic beer brewing process (Spitaels et al., 2014c). A fast dereplication technique based on MALDI-TOF MS enabled the processing of more

isolates from several phases during lambic beer pro-duction. Overnight cooled wort already contained high counts of Enterobacteriaceae in the cooling tun (106–107 CFU/ml). No yeasts were found in the lambic beer samples from the cooling tun (Spitaels et al., 2014c). The counts of the Enterobacteriaceae were the highest (108 CFU/ml) after 1–2 weeks. E. coli was again isolated, whereas Hafnia paralvei [an opportunistic human and animal pathogen (Huys et al., 2010)] was isolated instead of H. alvei. It is likely that isolates from previous studies were in fact also H. paralvei, as this species was separated from H. alvei only very recently (Huys et al., 2010). Other isolates in the Enterobacteriaceae phase were identified as Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter kobei,  Klebsiella  oxytoca,  Citrobacter  gillenii  and Raoultella terrigena (Spitaels et al., 2014c). All these species are coliform bacteria and thus indicator microorganisms for faecal contamination of sur-face waters and foods. Although these species are considered to be opportunistic pathogens, they are  commonly  found  in  various  spontaneously fermented foods and beverages, and some were previously isolated from lambic beer as well (Chao et al., 2013; Martens et al., 1991). Remarkably, most of these microorganisms have also been reported as spoilage microorganisms in sweet unfermented wort and pitching yeast (Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013; Van Vuuren and Priest, 2003; Vriesekoop et al., 2012) (see Chapter 10).
Debaryomyces  hansenii  and  S.  cerevisiae  were two yeast species isolated immediately after the transfer of the wort into the cask. S. pastorianus and Naumovia castelii were subsequently isolated from a 1-week-old wort sample. Debaryomyces hansenii is a known beer spoilage yeast (Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013), whereas N. castellii was previously known as Saccharomyces castellii and part of the Saccharo-myces sensu stricto group (Kurtzman, 2003). DNA originating from H. uvarum was detected in the community profiles of wort samples of traditionally produced lambic beer, but this species was not iso-lated (Spitaels et al., 2014c). Hanseniaspora uvarum originates from the fruit surfaces when thriving in wine and cider fermentation processes (Beltran et al., 2002), but it is known as an environmental contaminant in ales and lagers (Bokulich and Bam-forth, 2013; Manzano et al., 2011).
The Enterobacteriaceae phase was followed by the main fermentation phase or alcoholic fermentation
184 |  Spitaels et al.


phase, which started after 3 to 4 weeks. Saccharomy-ces spp. dominated the fermentation process from month 1 until month 4 (Spitaels et al., 2014c; Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus/pastorianus and S. uvarum were identified as the main actors during this stage (Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). High counts of S. cerevisiae and S. pastorianus were present at the start of the main fer-mentation phase, but after 3 months of fermentation most isolates were identified as S. pastorianus (Spi-taels et al., 2014c). Previous studies only reported the presence of S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus/S. pastori-anus and S. uvarum in the main fermentation phase and did not provide detailed information for differ-ent sampling moments. It is however not clear why S. pastorianus can outlive S. cerevisiae in the lambic beer fermentation process of a traditional brewery. The genomic background of the hybrid species S. pastorianus  was  recently  elucidated  (Libkind  et al., 2011). In Saccharomyces, hybridization events between cryotolerant and non-cryotolerant Sac-charomyces species offered a benefit for the resulting hybrids, because of the capacity of these hybrids to ferment at lower temperature (Peris et al., 2012). Consequently, all commonly used lager-type yeasts are domesticated strains of the initial pastorianus and bayanus hybrids (Libkind et al., 2011). The ambient temperature of the rooms where lambic beers are fermenting is rarely 20°C or higher during the first fermentation months, which may explain the predominance of S. pastorianus in a traditional lambic beer brewery process. Vidgren et al. (2010) reported that ale (generally S. cerevisiae) and lager (generally  S.  pastorianus  or  S.  bayanus)  strains exhibit a similar maltose transport activity at 20°C, but at 0°C the activity of lager strains is higher by the expression of cryotolerant maltose and maltotriose transporters. The different temperature sensitivity of the maltose and maltotriose transporters could have an influence on the survival of different Sac-charomyces hybrids, since the transport of these molecules is assumed to be the rate-limiting step in the utilization of these saccharides (Cousseau et al., 2013).
After the main fermentation phase, oxidative yeasts, i.e. Cryptococcus spp., Candida spp., Pichia spp. and Torulopsis spp. form a pellicle at the top of the liquid and serve as an oxygen barrier (Van Oev-elen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995).

Pediococcus damnosus (Pediococcus cerevisiae) was commonly isolated during and after this main fer-mentation phase, in addition to low counts of AAB [Acetobacter spp. and Gluconobacter (Acetomonas) spp.], which were isolated irregularly (Spitaels et al., 2014c; Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). Acetobacter lambici (Spitaels et al., 2014a) and Gluconobacter cerevisiae (Spitaels et al., 2014b), two newly described AAB species, were occasionally isolated during the lambic beer fermentation process. From 2 months onwards, P.  damnosus  was  consistently  present.  During this phase, the majority of the ethanol present in the lambic beers was produced, and the level of dimethyl  sulfide  (produced  during  the  Entero-
bacteriaceae phase) decreased, driven off by CO2
bubbles produced by the yeasts still present from the fermenting lambic beer (Verachtert and Iserent-ant, 1995). Simultaneously, higher alcohols, fatty acids and esters, including hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate and their ethyl esters, respectively, were formed as well (Spaepen et al., 1978; Van Oevelen et al., 1976; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995).
After 2–3 months of main fermentation and the depletion of the carbon sources that can be fer-mented by Saccharomyces spp. (simple saccharides up to maltotriose), an acidification phase has been reported that was characterized by the increasing isolation of Pediococcus and occasionally Lactoba-cillus strains (only in breweries with large casks), while Brettanomyces strains became prevalent after 4 to 8 months of fermentation. Simultaneously, the  number  of  Saccharomyces  yeasts  decreased (Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserent-ant, 1995). The acidification was characterized by a strong increase in lactic acid and ethyl lactate concentrations, which are typical metabolites of lambic beers (Van Oevelen et al., 1976; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). During the warm summer months, LAB can also cause slime in the fermenting lambic beer, which is undesirable (Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Van Oevelen and Verachtert, 1979).
Brettanomyces and LAB species have a synergistic effect on beer attenuation (Andrews and Gilliland, 1952; Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991). Bret-tanomyces spp. in combination with LAB degrade the residual dextrins that are not fermented by Saccharomyces spp. (Shanta Kumara and Verach-tert, 1991). Lambic beers reach a high attenuation during the maturation phase, resulting in a residual

gravity that may be below 1°P (Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). Super-attenuation or over-attenuation was already described by Andrews and Gilliland (1952), who demonstrated  that  a  primary  attenuation  limit, typical for an axenic S. cerevisiae culture, and a secondary attenuation limit, typical for an axenic B. bruxellensis culture, can still be overcome by the use of a mixed culture of yeasts and bacteria (Andrews and Gilliland, 1952). Hence, there is probably a synergistic effect of the yeast and bacterial cultures during  the  degradation  of  dextrins  and  starch (Andrews and Gilliland, 1952). A similar finding was reported by Shanta Kumara and Verachtert (1991), who demonstrated that Brettanomyces is the main contributor to the super-attenuation of lambic beers, but its effect is more pronounced in a mixed culture with Pediococcus (Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991). Brettanomyces produces an α-glucosidase, an enzyme capable of dextrin degra-dation (Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991). This α-glucosidase shows intracellular as well as extracel-lular activities and acts by removing a single glucose molecule from the dextrin polymer (De Cort et al., 1994; Shanta Kumara et al., 1993). The enzyme is fast-acting, as under optimal conditions malto-oligosaccharides  shorter  than  maltotetraose  are not found in the presence of the enzyme (Shanta Kumara et al., 1993). The low pH of lambic beers, however, may explain the slow process of over-attenuation in situ in lambic beers (Shanta Kumara et al., 1993).
After 10 months, the bacterial counts decrease and a new phase in the lambic beer fermentation process is initiated by the increase of Brettanomy-ces spp. During this phase, cell-bound esterases of Brettanomyces yeasts can form and degrade several esters in the fermenting lambic beer (Spaepen and Verachtert, 1982) and several metabolites and fla-vour compounds are produced by the synergistic action of LAB and Brettanomyces yeasts (Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991; Van Oevelen et al., 1976, 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). These include the esters ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate as well as the long-chain fatty acids and their esters such as ethyl caprylate and ethyl caprate (Spaepen et al., 1978). Only minimal concentrations of ethyl caprate are present in most other beers and this can thus be considered as a typical aroma compound of lambic beers (Spaepen et al., 1978). However,

a beer produced by the mixed fermentation of a LAB-harbouring pitching yeast with a secondary cask fermentation contains comparable concentra-tions of these long-chain fatty acids and their esters (Spaepen et al., 1979). At the end of this phase, after about 2 years, the number of LAB and Brettanomy-ces yeasts was reported to decrease (Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). AAB were also isolated during these phases.
However,  as  mentioned  above,  a  detailed analysis of the microbiota at 3 and 6 months of fermentation in a more recent study could not dis-criminate between the acidification and maturation phases (Spitaels et al., 2014c). A gradual decrease of Saccharomyces yeasts and a consecutive increase of  Brettanomyces  yeasts  was  not  found,  which is characteristic for the acidification phase. The number of LAB was elevated in the 6-month-old sample compared to the 3-month old sample, and reached counts that were comparable to those of Brettanomyces yeasts. Consequently, the acidifica-tion probably occurred very rapidly between the sampling at 3 and 6 months and it was therefore considered as a part of the long maturation phase. Indeed, yeast isolates from the 3-month-old sample were identified as Saccharomyces spp., while those of the 6-month-old sample were identified as Bret-tanomyces spp.
The ambient temperature of the cask storage room can influence the pace of fermentation and the ability of B. bruxellensis to dominate the fer-mentation, as shown by a batch-dependent species distribution during the fermentation phase (Spi-taels et al., 2014c). This phase can be dominated by B. bruxellensis or can have a more complex micro-biota and include several other yeast species, such as  Candida  patagonica,  Brettanomyces  anomalus, Pichia membranifaciens, Priceomyces carsonii, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus (Spitaels et al., 2014c). LAB were isolated from all samples after the Enterobacteriaceae phase. In contrast to previous studies, P. damnosus was the only LAB species found (Spitaels et al., 2014c). It is unclear why P. damnosus was the only LAB species isolated, while other studies reported the general presence of Lactobacillus spp., including Lactobacillus brevis, a well-known beer spoilage bacterium (De Cort et al., 1994; Shanta Kumara and Verachtert, 1991;
Vriesekoop et al., 2012).
The microbial communities present in 3-year-old
186 |  Spitaels et al.


lambic beer were highly similar to those present in the 2-year-old lambic beer and consisted of P. dam-nosus, A. lambici, P. membranifaciens, B. bruxellensis, B. anomalus, C. patagonica and W. anomalus (Spi-taels et al., 2015a). This contrasted with the results of Verachtert and Iserentant (1995), who reported a decrease in the counts of LAB and yeasts towards the end of the fermentation process and suggested that this microbiota is highly adapted to growth and survival in lambic beer.
Besides lambic beers, lambic beer brewers pro-duce gueuze and fruit lambic beers, while gueuze blenders buy lambic beers from lambic beer brew-ers to produce their own beers. Gueuze beers are produced by the re-fermentation of a mixture of young lambic beer that contains a lot of dextrins and old lambic beer that contains dextrin-hydrolysing microorganisms (Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). The pellicle yeasts survive in the initial stages of the re-fermentation process, although they do not multiply (Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). Their presence can be explained by breaking of the pel-licle during emptying of the casks.

The industrial lambic beer fermentation process
Nowadays, lambic beers are also produced on an industrial scale in several breweries in Belgium and the brewing processes have even been adopted in the USA, where the resulting beers are called Amer-ican coolship ales (ACAs; see below). The technical characteristics of both traditional and industrial production processes differ, which might influence the microbiota and thus the fermentation process. In an industrial process, lambic wort is made using an infusion mashing rather than a turbid mash-ing scheme, the wort is acidified at the end of the wort boiling to pH 4.0 using lactic acid and, finally, the wort is pre-chilled after boiling, before being transferred to the cooling tun. Together, this ena-bles an industrial brewery to produce lambic beers throughout the year. The data presented below were taken from Spitaels et al. (2015b).
In contrast to a traditional lambic beer fermen-tation process, none of the cooling tun samples of an industrial brewing process yielded DNA or isolates. Furthermore, members of the Enterobacte-riaceae could not be isolated, nor could their DNA be  detected  through  PCR-DGGE  experiments. Most likely, the acidification of the boiled wort

before chilling prevented the growth of Enterobac-teriaceae, which is known to be inhibited below pH 4.0 (Priest and Stewart, 2006). Bacteria and yeasts were isolated as soon as the cooled wort was transferred into the casks. These early isolates were identified as Pichia kudriavzevii, D. hansenii and Ace-tobacter orientalis and AAB were isolated from the start of fermentation up to 6 months, which again contrasted with a traditional fermentation process. S. cerevisiae was already dominant after 1 week of fermentation, but also B. bruxellensis was isolated from that sample. Pediococcus damnosus was present from 3 weeks onwards. If the dominance of B. brux-ellensis and P. damnosus is again used to demarcate the maturation phase, such as in a traditional lambic beer fermentation process (Spitaels et al., 2014c; Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995), then the main fermentation phase lasted for one month only. Hanseniaspora uvarum was not characteristic, as it was only found in the initial samples of a sluggishly starting fermentation batch, which confirmed that this species has a low fermen-tative capacity, as discussed above.
Overall,  the  microbiota  present  during  the maturation phase was the same as the one in a tradi-tional lambic beer fermentation process, although the species diversity was simpler. Similar to a tradi-tional lambic beer fermentation process, the main fermentation phase of an industrial lambic beer fer-mentation process was dominated by Saccharomyces spp. The dominant isolation of S. cerevisiae from one batch in the warm summer months supported the hypothesis that the dominance of S. pastorianus at the end of the lambic beer fermentation process in a traditional brewery was due to the tolerance of the maltose and maltotriose transporter of this species towards low temperatures.

The inoculation source of the spontaneous lambic beer fermentation process
Little is known about the inoculation sources that introduce the microbiota necessary for a spontane-ous lambic beer fermentation process. Previously, it has been claimed that a specific air microbiota is introduced into the wort in the cooling tun, and that lambic beer only could be produced in the Brussels area where the necessary microbiota were assumed to be indigenous. Air sampling revealed that some species, such as Brettanomyces spp., that
Microbial Ecology of Traditional Beers |  187


are characteristic of lambic beer, were present in the air of lambic beer breweries (Spitaels et al., 2014c; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). It is however unclear if this presence is a consequence of the pro-duction of lambic beers at that location, or a cause of the inoculation of the cooling wort. Cooling wort samples in the cooling tun of a traditional lambic beer  brewery  yielded  various  Enterobacteriaceae species  (both  through  cultivation  and  PCR-DGGE), but no LAB or other microorganisms (Spitaels et al., 2014c). LAB and yeasts might have been present in very low numbers in the cooling tun sample, compared to Enterobacteriaceae, which may have inhibited their detection by cultivation or via PCR-DGGE.
Besides the brewery air, the wood used in the brewery is another potential source of inoculation. Construction wood that is not covered or treated with paint is present in the truss of the cooling tun room and can be used as ceiling of the cask storage room of traditional breweries. The Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain published a guide for auto-control of hygienic conditions in breweries in 2007 (Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, 2007), which outlines that breweries should adopt easy-to-maintain sur-faces in the production area and prohibit the use of untreated wood. However, several exceptions were included for the production of spontaneously fer-mented beers. Ceilings of a brewery should be free of moisture, except for the cooling tun room when lambic beer is brewed. Additionally, the presence of untreated wood was allowed in the production areas of lambic beer and red-brown ale breweries (Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, 2007). These guidelines therefore acknowl-edge the importance of untreated wooden surfaces in the brewery as a potential source of microbiota that could be introduced into the wort.
Most likely, however, the reuse of non-sterile wooden barrels enhances the success of the fermen-tation, as is the case in natural cider fermentation processes (del Campo et al., 2003). Wooden tools and casks are known as safe harbours for bacteria and yeasts that are present during spontaneous fermentation of wines and ciders (Swafield and Scott, 1995; Swafield et al., 1997). These microor-ganisms can penetrate the wood in a short period of time, where they are protected from cleaning procedures  (Barata  et  al.,  2013;  Guzzon  et  al.,

2011).  Additionally,  these  microorganisms  can survive for a prolonged time in the pores via micro-oxygenation (De Rosso et al., 2008; Hidalgo et al., 2010; Torija et al., 2009). Clearly, it is conceivable also that the lambic beer microbiota will persist in cask wood after the cleaning procedure, which consists of washing the inside of the cask with cold water and a treatment with low-pressure steam. Yet spontaneous fermentation processes were reported successful even when new, unused casks and stain-less steel fermenters were used for the production of lambic beers (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005). The microbiota and metabolites of the lambic beers in the latter study were monitored over a period of 18 months and the typical characteristics of lambic beers were found (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005). These characteristics include the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Saccharomyces spp., Brettano-myces spp. and LAB, together with the presence of ethanol, acetic acid and lactic acid, and ethyl acetate and  ethyl  lactate  (Verachtert  and  Derdelinckx, 2005). Furthermore, the wort was highly attenuated and there was a clear drop in pH (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005). The authors also stated that all lambic worts will reach the expected characteristics of a lambic beer after a one-year fermentation, irrespective of the fermentation profile or initial microbial load of the individual worts (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005). Moreover, lambic beer fermentation was reported successful and yielded similar products when wort, brewed and cooled in a lambic brewery, was fermented in other lambic breweries  (Verachtert  and  Derdelinckx,  2005). Additionally, it should be noted that carbon diox-ide produced during the main fermentation phase in  traditional  lambic  beer  breweries  causes  an overflow of beer from the cask, which is sealed with a loose bung. The brewer tops the casks off with fer-menting wort from other casks to decrease the cask headspace and only replaces this temporary plug with a permanent wooden plug or rubber stopper after the main fermentation phase. These practices will influence the microbiota composition and the fermentation process. Together, these observations demonstrate that the sources of inoculation in a traditional lambic beer brewery may be diverse and brewery-dependent and/or that the impact of individual microorganisms on the resulting lambic beers may be overestimated. These data also dem-onstrated that lambic beer fermentation is robust in

the Senne river valley (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005).
Traditionally, the production of lambic beers was assumed to be only possible in the Senne river valley and the use of the cooling tun enabled the inoculation of the wort with the microbiota that were uniquely present in the air of the Senne river valley (Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). However, two breweries in west Flanders and therefore located outside the Senne river valley, and several American craft breweries have successfully adopted spontane-ous fermentation processes for the production of lambic beers and ACAs, respectively (Bokulich et al., 2012). It was found that overnight cooled wort samples from the cooling tun of an industrial lambic brewing process were not inoculated (Spitaels et al., 2015b). In contrast, as soon as wort was transferred into the casks, there was a detectable microbiota through cultivation. This unambiguously indicated that in such a brewing process, the microbiota responsible for the fermentation did not originate from the air and, hence, the Senne river valley is not a conditio sine qua non. In addition, the industrial lambic beer fermentation process lacked an Entero-bacteriaceae phase, while such a phase was present in a traditional lambic beer fermentation process (Spi-taels et al., 2014c, 2015b; Van Oevelen et al., 1977; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995) and in the ACA fermentation process (Bokulich et al., 2012). In an industrial brewery all surfaces are typically covered or treated with antifungal paint, which renders the surfaces smooth and easy to clean. Hence, there are no untreated wooden surfaces in such a brewery, except for the cask wood. Consequently, the influ-ence of the cask wood on the successful inoculation and subsequent lambic beer fermentation is likely to be higher in an industrial brewing process. The wort in an industrial lambic brewing process is chilled and the air flow in and near the cooling tun is upwards instead of sideways or downwards. The chilling temperature may influence the microbial growth in the cooling tun. Indeed, the wort of a slug-gishly fermenting batch in such a brewery (Spitaels et al., 2015b) was chilled to a lower temperature than applied normally. Another batch was correctly chilled and isolates were obtained from the freshly transferred cask wort sample and the fermenta-tion was initiated within one week (Spitaels et al., 2015b). Hence, the wort did not contain bacteria when it was transferred to the cask and only the low

fermentative H. uvarum yeasts grew, rather than Sac-charomyces spp. (Spitaels et al., 2015b). ‘Rebooting’ such sluggishly fermenting lambic beer batches by mixing it with another batch is a commonly applied procedure in industrial brewing processes and new barrels are filled with fermenting lambic wort prior to their first use. Most likely, the production of lambic beers in such a brewery is facilitated through a lambic beer core microbiota that is enriched in the cask wood. The close monitoring and mixing of aberrantly fermenting batches enables the brewery to control the fermentation process outcome. The lambic beer fermentation in an industrial brewing process is therefore successful without inoculation in the cooling tun and the transfer of chilled wort into a cask used previously for lambic beer produc-tion is suficient to obtain a normal lambic beer fermentation  process.  However,  when  the  wort would be cooled and transferred directly into a clean stainless steel tank, the fermentation probably will not take place, as described in the production of cider (del Campo et al., 2003).


The microbiota and metabolites of ageing gueuze beers
Young and old lambic beers are blended by the brewer to make gueuze beers, which spontaneously re-ferment after bottling, a process that is referred to as ‘ageing’. Gueuze beers bottled between 5 months and 17 years prior to the sampling have been examined to study the changes in microbiota and metabolites that can be used as a proxy of the processes  that  occur  during  gueuze  maturation (Spitaels et al., 2015a). All gueuze beers showed the characteristic presence of B. bruxellensis and comprised acetic acid, lactic acid, ethyl acetate, and ethyl lactate as the most abundant metabolites. While pediococci were readily isolated from 1-, 2-and 3-year-old lambic beers, and from a gueuze beer bottled a few months before sampling, LAB or any other bacteria were no longer isolated from gueuze beers bottled more than 3 years prior to sampling (Spitaels  et  al.,  2015a).  Different  yeast  species including B. bruxellensis, B. anomalus, P. membrani-faciens, and S. cerevisiae were isolated from recently bottled gueuze, but this diversity decreased with age until only B. bruxellensis was isolated via enrich-ment culturing, even from the 17-year-old gueuze beer. The low nutritional demand of this yeast

species probably enabled its long-term survival in this environment (Aguilar Uscanga et al., 2000; Renouf et al., 2007). The latter is also supported by the versatile metabolism of Brettanomyces yeasts, which can both produce and assimilate carbon sources such as acetic acid and ethanol (Renouf et al., 2007). The yeast cells in these old gueuze beers most likely occurred in a VBNC state that could be reversed by the enrichment procedure. The VBNC state allows yeast (and bacterial) cells to withstand several  stress  conditions  (Millet  and  Lonvaud-Funel, 2000).
Further, the metabolite analyses revealed that the ageing of gueuze beer is probably limited in time by the depletion of the available malto-oligosaccha-rides (Spitaels et al., 2015a). Malto-oligosaccharide concentrations were very low in 9-year-old and 17-year-old gueuze beer samples and no further increase in the concentrations of lactic acid was found in these gueuze beer samples (Spitaels et al., 2015a). Furthermore, the acetic acid concentrations were the lowest in the 17-year-old gueuze beers, suggesting that acetic acid was further metabolized and that no new acetic acid was produced. Lactic acid concentrations increased steadily for beers aged up to 10 years, but no further increase was noticed in the beers that were aged for 17 years.
Additionally, the typical fruitiness was no longer perceived in the sensory analysis in the oldest gueuze beers examined (Spitaels et al., 2015a). This was probably caused by the degradation of the fatty acid ethyl esters, which are known to add fruitiness in beer. The increasing concentrations of ethyl lactate and decreasing concentrations of ethyl decanoate could be considered as positive and negative gueuze beer-ageing metabolite biomark-ers, respectively.


Ecology of lambic-style ACA beers
Acidic beers are currently attracting interest world-wide, especially in the USA (Bokulich et al., 2012). In the American craft brewing industry, which is the collective name for small- to mid-scale brewer-ies, the production of lambic beers is mimicked and the resulting beers are called ACAs (Bokulich et al., 2012). Breweries adopt the open cooling vessels and fermentations are performed in wooden casks or stainless steel fermentation tanks (Bokulich et

al., 2012). The microbiota of an ACA fermentation process has been studied using primarily culture-independent techniques (Bokulich et al., 2012). Culture-dependent techniques were limited to the use of two aerobically incubated bacterial isolation media, the collection of two bacterial isolates per colony morphotype and their identification using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis (Bokulich et al., 2012), a technique not suficiently discrimi-natory  for  accurate  species  level  identification (Cleenwerck et al., 2010; De Bruyne et al., 2007, 2008; Mollet et al., 1997; Naser et al., 2007). The community diversity of multiple barrels of mul-tiple fermentation batches was studied through bar-coded 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymor-phism (T-RFLP), a technique with a sensitivity similar to that of DGGE but with a higher automa-tion capacity (Bokulich and Mills, 2012). Bacterial numbers  were  studied  using  quantitative  PCR assays (Bokulich et al., 2012).
Bokulich et al. (2012) reported fermentation phases in the production of ACAs similar to those of lambic beer fermentation processes. Enterobac-teriaceae and some oxidative yeasts dominated the first phase of the fermentation, but S. cerevisiae was immediately the most dominant yeast (Bokulich et al., 2012). Members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were dominant up to 1 month, but some species were isolated up to 12 weeks into the fermentation process (Bokulich et al., 2012). ACAs are seasonal products of these breweries and it is likely that S. cerevisiae is enriched in the brewery environment by its use in other types of beers produced in these breweries, probably explaining their early domi-nance during ACA fermentation (Bokulich et al., 2012). From week 4 onwards, LAB were the most dominant bacteria; Lb. brevis was the only bacterial species isolated during the whole fermentation pro-cess, but Pediococcus was the most dominant LAB from week 4 onwards based on T-RFLP and BAS analyses (Bokulich et al., 2012). Brettanomyces was detected from week 11 onwards in minor numbers, but was dominant after 1 year. Low numbers of AAB were found during the whole fermentation process (Bokulich et al., 2012). Interestingly, the fermentation profiles were very similar between batches and between barrels, even when barrels had a different origin, were new or reused (Bokulich et al., 2012).

Ecology of red-brown acidic beers
West of the Scheldt in Belgium, non-spontaneous mixed acid beer fermentation was originally applied for beer production where hops were replaced by herbs (called ‘gruyt’). Non-spontaneous mixed fer-mentation is used in two types of Belgian acidic ales, namely the red acidic ales of south-west Flanders (Roeselare) and the red-brown acidic ales that are produced in south-west and south-east Flanders. The red acidic ales of south-west Flanders were traditionally produced using an in-house starter culture that contains yeasts and LAB, by the reuse of the starter in every fermentation batch (Martens et al., 1997). The level of bacteria is kept low by acid washing (mainly with phosphoric acid) of the yeast suspension (Martens et al., 1997). These ales have a vinous acidic character and their production starts with mashing of malted barley and cooked unmalted maize (Martens et al., 1997). The main ethanol  fermentation  phase  proceeds  for  about seven days and is followed by a secondary lactic acid fermentation phase that proceeds for another 4–5 weeks (Martens et al., 1997). Finally, a long maturation phase of 20 to 24 months occurs in large oak casks and P. damnosus and Pediococcus parvulus, together with Brettanomyces spp. and AAB (sup-ported by natural microoxygenation through the wood) are an active part of the microbiota during this phase (Martens et al., 1997). These results were confirmed by a recent study using BAS on red-brown finished beer samples, which revealed that the most abundant microbial species present in these beers were P. damnosus, B. bruxellensis and A. pasteurianus (Snauwaert et al., 2016). The draft genome representative strain of P. damnosus, isolated from a maturation phase sample of these beers, was recently sequenced (Snauwaert et al., 2015). Furthermore, additional operational taxo-nomic units were assigned to Candida, Lactobacillus and an unclassified fungal community member. This ‘tandem’ fermentation process (the main fer-mentation phase followed by cask maturation) was imported into Belgium around 1860 from northern England, where it was used for the production of old English Porter beer (Claussen, 1904; Martens et al., 1997). Brettanomyces spp. were present in old English Porter beer until the production process was altered and stainless steel fermentation vessels


were used instead of wooden casks, indicating that contact with wooden casks is an important feature for supporting the growth of this yeast (Martens et al., 1997). The production of red-brown acidic ales is very similar, with the fermentation being initi-ated by re-pitching of LAB-harbouring yeast starter cultures and the use of open fermentation vessels from which the yeast is harvested at the end of the fermentation phase, followed by maturation in oak vessels (Martens, 1996; Martens et al., 1997). Red-brown acidic ales differ from old brown ales in that the latter beers are not oak-aged, but they are also produced in south-east Flanders.


Other mixed beer fermentations

Berliner Weisse
Berliner Weisse is a trademarked beer that may be brewed only in Berlin, following European Union regulations (Burberg and Zarnkow, 2009). It is minimally  characterized  microbiologically.  The mash is made with a 2:1 to 3:1 ratio of wheat malt and barley malt, has a low initial gravity of around 7°P to 9°P and the level of carbonation in the fin-ished product is high (Burberg and Zarnkow, 2009; Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005). Traditionally, the wort is not boiled, but rather cooled directly after lautering, with the hops being added during the mashing, although in modern Berliner Weisse production a heating step is incorporated (Burberg and Zarnkow, 2009; Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005). The fermentation is traditionally carried out in an open fermenter by the reuse of a yeast culture that harbours LAB and generally has a 4:1 to 6:1 yeast: LAB ratio (Burberg and Zarnkow, 2009). The secondary fermentation is carried out in bot-tles by the addition of Kräusen (a yeast layer that is formed on top of the fermenting beer) to the green beer in the bottles, after which the bottles are stored for from 3 weeks to 2 years (Burberg and Zarnkow, 2009). The resulting beer is 95% attenuated and has a pH of 3.0 (Burberg and Zarnkow, 2009). More recently, these beers are also produced by divid-ing the wort into two parts, after which one half is fermented with a homofermentative Lactobacillus and the other half with ale yeast (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005).

Sorghum beers
On the African continent, tropical cereals such as maize and sorghum are used for the production of beers, since barley (a cool-season, temperate cereal) cultivation is not viable (Taylor, 2003). Moreover, sorghum is the only viable food grain in regions with semi-arid and subtropical climatic conditions (Taylor, 2003). Sorghum beers are widely produced in sub-Saharan Africa and are well-known under their  local  names,  such  as  burukutu  (Nigeria), tchapalo (Ivory Coast), dolo (Burkina Faso), pito (Ghana), munkoyo (Zambia) and bili bili (Chad) (Abegaz, 2007; Faparusi et al., 1973; Lyumugabe et al., 2010, 2013; Marcellin et al., 2009; N’guessan et al., 2011; Nanadoum and Pourquie, 2009; Sawa-dogo-Lingani et al., 2007; Schoustra et al., 2013; Taylor, 2003; van der Aa Kühle et al., 2001; Zulu et al., 1997). Sorghum beers are traditionally opaque, but some commercial clear versions exist as well (Hibbett and Taylor, 2013; Nanadoum and Pour-quie, 2009). These beers are mostly produced by the women of agropastoral families (which perform agriculture by growing crops and keeping livestock) on a weekly basis and are often sold (Dancause et al.,  2010).  Production  methods  differ  between countries and recipes are often household specific (Taylor, 2003).
As an example, the production of bili bili starts with a malting of the sorghum grains; steeping, germination, and drying of the grains takes about 1 week (Nanadoum and Pourquie, 2009). After the milling of the sorghum malt, the flour is steeped for at least 2 hours, after which the supernatant is removed from the residue (Nanadoum and Pour-quie, 2009). The residue is cooked for an average of 2 hours to ensure gelatinization of the starch (Nanadoum and Pourquie, 2009). The thick mash of the residue is mixed with the supernatant at a temperature of 65°C to 70°C. Subsequently, this mixture is left to cool overnight in open air (Nana-doum  and  Pourquie,  2009).  During  overnight cooling, the wort acidifies through the action of LAB, which are spontaneously inoculated from either the sorghum malt or from the surrounding air (Nanadoum and Pourquie, 2009). Alternatively, in some sorghum beers, the LAB are introduced by backslopping (Taylor, 2003). In dolo and pito beers, Lactobacillus fermentum is reported as the predominant LAB (Sawadogo-Lingani et al., 2007), whereas in burukutu beer the predominant LAB are

identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (Faparusi et al., 1973). After boiling the acidified wort, either dried yeast obtained from a previous fermentation or backslopping from the previous beer is added to start the fermentation, in which S. cerevisiae dominates (Nanadoum and Pourquie, 2009). This yeast species is dominant in all sor-ghum beer main fermentation phases, which take place overnight (Faparusi et al., 1973; N’guessan et al., 2011; Nanadoum and Pourquie, 2009; van der Aa Kühle et al., 2001). The next morning, the beer is ready to be sold and has a shelf-life of about one day (Nanadoum and Pourquie, 2009). In burukutu beer, also a high number of AAB is found, which are now all classified as Gluconobacter oxydans (Fapa-rusi et al., 1973).

Other cereal-based beverages

Chicha
Chicha is a traditional beverage produced in South America and was already produced by the Incas (Vallejo et al., 2013). The production starts by steep-ing and germination of maize grains to get a maize malt (Vallejo et al., 2013). Alternatively, the maize is chewed to convert the starch into fermentable sugars by the action of the amylase in saliva (Gomes et al., 2009). Besides maize, also cassava and cane sugar can be used in the production of chicha (Gomes et al., 2009). After cooking, the mixture is poured into clay pots, which are buried, and the liquid is left to ferment for 1 up to 6 days (Gomes et al., 2009; Vallejo et al., 2013). The end-product of the fermentation primarily contains S. cerevisiae yeasts (Vallejo et al., 2013). As these beers are pro-duced locally and the recipe can differ between two producers, the microorganisms present in the beers can differ greatly. Several LAB are described to be involved in chicha fermentation, including Lb. plan-tarum, Weissellaviridescens, Enterococcusfaecium and Leuc. mesenteroides (Elizaquivel et al., 2015). Since the clay fermentation pots are reused for every fer-mentation and no bacteria or yeasts are pitched to start the fermentation, the microbiota involved in the fermentation of chicha probably penetrate into the clay surface; a new yeast species, Candida theae, was recently isolated from chicha clay fermentation pots found in a tomb (Chang et al., 2012).

Boza
Boza is a fermented beverage that is produced in Turkey and other Balkan countries (Kabak and Dobson,  2011).  Its  production  starts  with  the boiling of a mixed flour of millet, rice, and wheat, and water (Kabak and Dobson, 2011). After filter-ing, the supernatant is inoculated with a part of a previous fermentation batch of boza, sourdough, or yoghurt (Altay et al., 2013; Kabak and Dobson, 2011). The mixture ferments at 30°C for 24 hours (Altay et al., 2013; Botes et al., 2007; Kabak and Dobson, 2011). The microbiota present during the fermentation can vary significantly, depending on the inoculum and region of production. Generally, a range of LAB is found during these fermentations, including Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc spp. (Altay et al., 2013; Botes et al., 2007; Kabak and Dobson, 2011). Several yeast species are found, but in con-trast to other fermented cereal-based beverages, Saccharomyces spp. are not always present (Botes et al., 2007). Instead, Candida spp. and Pichia spp. can be the dominant yeasts in boza fermentation (Altay et al., 2013; Botes et al., 2007; Kabak and Dobson, 2011). Opportunistic pathogenic yeasts have been isolated from Bulgarian boza, highlighting the need for starter cultures (Botes et al., 2007). The shelf-life of boza is about 15 days and it is acceptable for consumption until the pH drops below 3.5 (Altay et al., 2013).


Future perspectives
Further research of the lambic beer fermentation process and other traditional beer fermentation processes in other breweries (traditional, industrial, or  those  with  intermediate  characteristics)  will reveal the extent to which the overall microbiota described is generic, or if novel species will be dis-covered. The isolates obtained in these studies can be used for the production of these traditional beers in a controlled way, but they can also be applied in other beer types, since they are thought to be more persistent in the fermentation process, as they dominate the fermentation without the need of being pitched in large amounts. Consequently, brewing with these isolates would make the beer less prone to microbial spoilage. The yeasts present in traditional beers are also known to survive a long time during bottle re-fermentation, which is a very

interesting property of yeast strains for ale bottle re-fermentation as well.
The role of yeast species that are not commonly isolated from fermented beverages also deserves further attention. The isolation of Yarrowia lipol-ytica at late phases of the lambic beer fermentation from both traditional and industrial lambic brewing processes suggests an advantage of this species to survive and prevail in lambic beers. Cheese is the main food product from which this yeast is isolated, next to fermented and raw meat products, but it has also been isolated occasionally from soft drinks, wines, and ciders (Groenewald et al., 2014).
Finally, although the source of the microbiota in an industrial lambic brewing process seems to be known, the sources of lambic microbiota are unclear in traditional lambic beer brewing processes. Sev-eral findings indicate a role for both brewery air and untreated construction wood and cask wood, but this may differ between breweries (Verachtert and Derdelinckx, 2005; Verachtert and Iserentant, 1995). All these breweries have produced lambic beers for a long time and the entire environment is probably enriched with the lambic beer microbiota. The precise mode of inoculation might therefore remain part of the mystery and tradition of lambic beer and traditional beers in general.

Abstract
Fungal contamination of barley and malt results in a high economic burden from malt yield loss, qual-ity failure, and costs connected to the presence of toxic fungal secondary metabolites, i.e. mycotoxins. This chapter describes the routes and factors that influence fungal contamination of cereals and malt, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as the consequences which fungal growth may have in terms of malt and beer quality. Focus is given to the role of mycotoxins and their fate during malt-ing and brewing as well as to recent research in the field of beer gushing. Since analysis is a strong tool to prevent fungi and their metabolites from enter-ing the malt-beer chain, recent developments in the analytical toolbox are discussed, including chemical and molecular biology-based approaches. Finally, possible ways for the prevention of fungal growth in the field and during malting are discussed.


Introduction
Fungal contamination of agricultural commodities results in worldwide economic burden from yield loss, quality failure, and costs connected to the presence of toxic fungal secondary metabolites, i.e.  mycotoxins.  Some  rough  calculations  may help to illustrate the magnitude of the problems induced by fungal contamination of barley and it can be concluded that they may be transferable to other crops such as wheat and sorghum as crops of minor worldwide importance for the brewing

industry. Based on data from 17 different regions of the world for the period 1996–1998, Oerke and Dehne (2004) estimated loss potentials due to four different pest groups (weeds, animal pests, fungal and bacterial pathogens, viruses) for major crops such as wheat, rice, maize, barley, potatoes, soybeans, sugar beet and cotton. They estimated loss potential to be about 50% for barley with actual losses of up to 26–30% occurring under unfavour-able conditions. Of the actual losses, about 15% are accounted for by fungal and bacterial pathogens with no information given about the proportion of fungal pathogens in this estimate. We would tend to give it a 50% share in this calculation. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, (FAO, 2009) barley is the second most important coarse grain crop with a worldwide production of 136 mil-lion metric tons in 2007 harvested on 56.6 million hectares of acreage. Taking the above figures into consideration, an estimated loss of 10.2 million metric tons in worldwide barley production may occur due to fungal pathogens. Based on an average price of 180 $US per metric ton (feed/malt barley), this amounts to a worldwide annual loss of $1.8 bil-lion (US) in agribusiness. Of the 136 million metric tons of barley harvested in 2007, an estimated 21.36 million metric tons of malt have been produced (FAO, 2009) meaning a raw material consumption of approximately 27 million metric tons of screened barley (conversion factor from raw material to malt 1.267). Thus there is a total world production of approximately 30 million metric tons of malting

barley or $6.2 billion of turnover in global agribusi-ness.
The  FAO  have  previously  published  a  25% estimate for the proportion of total food supply contaminated by the major mycotoxins in precari-ously high concentrations (Mannon and Johnson, 1985). Given the fact that this estimate is also true for malting barley, five million metric tons of that commodity can be supposed to be either unfit for processing in the malt house and have to go to alter-native uses (with reduction in producer benefit) or can be sold only to the malt producer at a reduced price, both measures adding up to further losses. Costs  for  mycotoxin  management  can  only  be roughly estimated since they are influenced by sev-eral different cost factors such as research, testing, detoxification, discarding, health costs and insur-ance. For the situation in the USA, Vardon (2003) estimated  an  annual  range  of  cumulated  losses from $0.5 million to over $1.5 billion only from the major mycotoxins aflatoxin (maize and peanuts), fumonisin (maize, wheat, barley), and deoxyniva-lenol (DON) (wheat, barley). Uncertainties were built into the cost model based on commodity outputs, prices, and contamination levels based on surveillance samples and compliance with FDA regulatory limits.
Wheat and barley scab (head blight) induced by Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum is an excellent example of the high economic and social impact of fungal contamination of cereals. Accord-ing to Windels (2000), the losses in the United States agricultural production of wheat and barley caused by several severe outbreaks of the disease in the 1990s and early 2000s were estimated to be close to $3 billion including losses of $400 million in barley production. Costs were due to reduction both of yield and quality and led to a considerable change both in agricultural practice and cropping systems and also in the social structure of rural communities in affected regions due to farm exits and depopulation. As a consequence, malt produc-ers and breweries suffered from problems with mycotoxins (DON, fumonisin) and gushing due to fungal contamination as well as from a shortage in barley supply which had to be compensated for by import of (more expensive) raw materials.
However, fungal contamination of brewing cere-als means more than the potential contamination of commodities with mycotoxins. Fungi influence the

quality of barley, wheat and sorghum and the malts produced from them by altering their composi-tion and structure thereby influencing parameters such as malt colour, wort filterability, fermentation performance, beer colour and aroma. They may influence the brewing process by interfering with the metabolism of the barley grain during malting or with the yeast metabolism during brewing. They often leave tiny amounts of highly potent proteins causing the gushing of beer.
Current research on the taxonomy, physiology, and toxicology of barley- and malt-related fungi has provided a deeper insight into the way these organ-isms interact with their environment and how this interaction influences the quality of brewing malt and beer. Results from this research may help to cope with some of the problems related to fungal contamination of brewing raw materials and thus help to find solutions to the benefit of the brewing industry.
The  following  chapter  provides  an  overview of published research about the influences fungal organisms have on barley and malt and how they interfere with the brewing process and with the final product. Moreover, the following chapter will discuss gaps in our knowledge regarding fungal contamination of barley and malt as well as its man-agement.


Ecological considerations (microbial ecology)
The associated mycobiota describes the community of fungi (filamentous fungi and yeasts) present in a particular type of habitat such as barley (Andersen et  al.,  1996).  From  a  brewer’s  perspective  the habitat of major interest is the seed produced by the cereal plant at the end of the vegetation period. However, there are numerous other habitats with their  own  typical  associated  mycobiota  which may interfere and influence the mycobiota associ-ated with the cereal seeds used as raw material in the processes of malt and beer production. These mutual interactions between associated mycobiotas of, for example, soil, air, rain, insects, weed plants or agricultural equipment can be supposed to have an immediate influence on the composition of the spectrum of species present on or in the grain after harvest. However, this influence is quite small as compared to the influences acting selectively on

a fungal propagule in a particular habitat. Once a fungal propagule has been deposited on a cereal plant there are several environmental factors that determine whether the association is temporary or becomes permanent. Physical factors such as water potential, temperature, pH, light and radia-tion, redox potential and surface texture as well as physiological factors such as water availability, pres-ence and availability of micro and macro nutrients, presence of antimicrobials produced by the plant or by other microorganisms, presence of predators, parasites, competitors or pathogens will decide the survival of a propagule in its microenvironment. All these factors have a selective action that stabilizes a typical mycobiota associated with a particular type of habitat. Moreover, the physiological properties of the propagule and the host influence the type of association with the host. Interactions can be neu-tral, saprophytic or parasitic.
In  order  to  survive  under  environmentally stressful conditions fungi may follow three fun-damentally  different  strategies  of  competition with  other  microorganisms  (Pugh  and  Boddy, 1988; Widden, 1997; Magan et al., 2003). The first of those can be described as outcompeting competitors by fast rates of growth and reproduc-tion (ruderal type or r-selected type). The ruderal strategy is regularly followed by many species in the Chytridiomycota and in the Zygomycota. The second strategy is to outcompete other microorganisms by tolerance to stress against environmental condi-tions such as low temperature, low water activity, high salt content or use of antifungal compounds (stress type or s-selected type). The extreme xero-philic fungus Xeromyces bisporus and some species in Eurotium would be examples for that group. The third group of species uses a strategy of confronta-tion by competing with other species for nutrients and space by producing a variety of (anti-micro-bial) secondary metabolites (competitive type or c-selected type). Some of the c-selected species even combine production of metabolites with high reproduction rates, e.g. species of Penicillium and Aspergillus. Because of their ability to produce sec-ondary metabolites which eventually are harmful for animals and humans, i.e. mycotoxins, the latter category of species is the one giving the highest concern in regard to the safety and hygiene of brew-ing cereals and malt.

Routes of fungal colonization of cereal grains and malt
Colonization of cereal grain used for malt produc-tion by fungi can basically occur via several different routes. Unspecific superficial colonization occurs by fungal and yeast propagules that are transported through air movement or are washed out from the atmosphere with rainfall. Such propagules are deposited directly on any part of the plant, includ-ing the ears. Fungi in that category mostly have small dry and mostly pigmented spores enabling them to survive long periods of dryness and irradia-tion by sunlight without suffering any physiological or genetic damage. Typically the propagules are unable to germinate and grow under the conditions in the field. During harvesting, threshing and trans-port manipulations, propagules resting on parts of the plant other than the grain are homogeneously distributed  to  the  harvested  grains.  Under  the conditions of storage they can survive for longer periods of time and will germinate and grow as the
water content of barley exceeds 14–15% and CO2
accumulates at elevated temperatures (Magan and Lacey, 1984). Hence the name storage fungi.
Fungal species collectively summarized as the field fungi have evolved mechanisms enabling them to colonize the cereal plant by growing on its sur-face or even by penetrating its tissues. Deposition by airflow over greater distances is rather rare in such species since they are mostly unfit for survival in dryness and under sunlight irradiation. Species of field fungi are rather distributed by short-range deposition of ascospores by wind flow (Osborne and Stein, 2007; Xu and Nicholson, 2009), by rain splash (Ooka and Kommedahl, 1977; Madden, 1997) or by using insect vectors (Hajek and St. Leger, 1994) with a distribution radius of viable inoculum within a short distance ranging between centimetres and a few metres. Cereal grains are colonized by field species either by propagules deposited  directly  on  the  ear  or  indirectly  by mycelia that have penetrated tissues remote from the ear and grow towards it subcutaneously (Kang and  Buchenauer,  2000).  True  plant  pathogens such as Septoria tritici or Septoria nodorum can actively penetrate tissues (Cohen and Eyal, 1993; Eyal,  1999)  and  infect  cereal  grains  and  other parts of the plant. Other species such as Fusarium culmorum  and  F.  graminearum  can  only  enter

through injuries (mechanical damage, insect bite), preformed entrances (stomata) or very soft tissues (stamina, pistil and stigma of the gynoecium) and use production of mycotoxins such as DON and nivalenol (NIV) as virulence factors to undergo cel-lular defence mechanisms (Baiet al., 2002; Wagacha and Muthomi, 2007). Several pathogenic species of field fungi such as F. culmorum, Microdochium nivale or Bipolaris sorokiniana penetrate the plant during seedling germination either from inoculum present in the surrounding soil or from inoculum present as a seed borne infection (Knudsen et al., 1995; Bonde et al., 1997; Al-Sadi and Deadman, 2010). For some species symptomless growth within infected plants has been demonstrated where infection eventually may reach the developing grain.
Once the malting process has started by steeping the cereal grains in water, fungal propagules present on the surface or within the grain tissue will be acti-vated and start growing and multiplying according to their ecological and physiological preferences. Initial inoculum of r-selected species will be dis-tributed very quickly and evenly over the complete batch to grow and multiply immediately. An inocu-lum of s-selected species will be distributed quite evenly over the batch but since conditions will not be optimal for them, they will be unable to compete. Inoculum of c-selected species such as Fusarium spp., Alternaria spp., Epicoccum nigrum or Bipolaris sorokiniana will further develop on grains in which the species are present with some superficial spread first to neighbouring grains and later to be wider distributed as the malting process proceeds with mechanical turning of the green malt.


The microbial community of brewing barley and malt
In general, the microbial community found on or in barley seeds may contain numerous species from five principle groups, i.e. viruses, bacteria, fungi, slime moulds and protozoa. The presence of viruses on the surface of barley seeds or within their inte-rior parts is a generally unexplored field of research. Because of its role as a seed borne pathogen of barley, the barley stripe mosaic virus and its asso-ciation with barley grains have been studied more intensively (Mink, 1993). However, the presence and impact of symptomless barley viruses on the microbiota present on or in the barley seed has not

been studied to date. Also the impact that viruses associated with fungi (mycoviruses) or bacteria (bacteriophages) may have on individual species or on the community of microorganisms present on or in barley seeds is as yet unknown. However, an influ-ence can be assumed since many plant pathogenic fungi and endophytic fungi of grasses have been found to carry mycoviruses (see comprehensive literature compilations by Pearson et al. (2009) and by Herrero et al. (2009). According to the literature, many fungal species undergo modifications of their phenotype leading to increased or decreased viru-lence of virus infected strains of plant pathogens. This effect has been observed in species which are important to the quality and yield of barley, e.g. F. graminearum or F. culmorum (Chu et al., 2002), Alternaria alternata (Aoki et al., 2009) including potential production of mycotoxins by Aspergillus species (Varga et al., 1994). On the other hand, the link between mycoviruses and the production of fungal secondary metabolites has been observed as well (Detroy and Worden, 1979). Where knowl-edge about specific interaction of fungal viruses with their host and of the impact of this interaction on the barley microbiota is scarce, knowledge of this relation in bacteria and their respective phages is even more negligible. However, this relation has been intensively studied in areas such as medicine (Merril et al., 2003), biotechnology or food fer-mentation, where bacteriophages play an important role (Emond and Moineau, 2007). It can therefore be speculated that bacteria present on or in barley seeds will interact with bacterial viruses and that their numbers and activity will also be influenced, either positively or negatively.
Occurrence of slime moulds (Mycetozoa) and protozoans on cereal seeds has been reported by some authors (Pepper and Kiesling, 1963; Mills and Frydman, 1980). However, no representative data about their presence or about the species and groups (plasmodial or cellular slime moulds, amoeboid or ciliate protozoa) prevailing have been presented or published elsewhere. The fact that slime moulds and protozoa feed on living and dead bacteria, yeasts, and fungi might point to a certain yet unspecified effect of slime moulds and protozo-ans on the microbial community when present on barley seeds (Hohl and Raper, 1993).
Bacteria  together  with  fungal  organisms  can be supposed to be the groups with the greatest
Fungal Contamination of Barley and Malt |  201


influence on the properties of barley grain since they occur regularly in higher numbers and many of them are physiologically able to use grain com-ponents as nutrient source. According to Roberts et al. (2005), the bacterial consortium consists of aerobic mesophilic bacteria (no growth at 10°C or less, optimum growth between 20°C and 40°C, colony  count  from  102   to  106 cfu/g),  psychro-trophic bacteria (growth occurs at 7°C or less, growth optimum >20°C, colony count from 104 to >105 cfu/g), actinomycetes (up to 106 cfu/g), aerobic  spore-forming  bacteria  (colony  counts from  100   to  105 cfu/g)  and  coliform  bacteria (colony counts from 102 to 104 cfu/g). An overview of bacterial species that have been isolated from barley grain was compiled by Pepper and Kiesling (1963) and, more recently, by Noots et al. (1999). The spectrum shows a variety of different species. Many of them belong to Gram-negative genera such  as  Alcaligenes,  Clavibacterium,  Enterobacter, Erwinia, Escherichia, Flavibacterium, Pseudomonas or Xanthomonas. Gram positive species represent the genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus,  Leuconostoc,  Micrococcus  and  Ther-moactinomyces. Some genera are represented by only one species, e.g. Arthrobacter, Aplanobacter, Brevibacterium,   Corynebacterium,   Kurthia   and Pediococcus. Moreover, groups of unidentified bac-teria were summarized as white and yellow bacteria. Filamentous bacteria were summarized as actino-mycetes with no further differentiation into species. The community of fungal species on or in barley seeds and malt grain is subject to change through the production process, starting from the devel-oping ear and grain, through harvested grain and ending with the kilned malt. As depicted in Fig. 8.1, the mycobiota is subject to dynamic change in bio-mass and species spectrum over time. Typical field fungi such as Alternaria spp., Cladosporium spp., Curvularia spp., Drechslera spp., Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium spp., Microdochium spp., Nigrospora spp., Septoria spp., Trichoderma spp., dominate the spec-trum of fungal species because they are able to use the developing grain as substrate without neces-sarily damaging or killing the embryo. However, many other fungal species representing all major taxonomic groups can be found upon plating of whole barley grains or dilutions of barley meal. The spectrum of fungal species identified from a barley sample varies greatly with time, especially during

storage since many species in the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium but also typical xerophiles such as Eurotium spp. or Wallemia sebi only start to develop and multiply after harvest when the water activity of grains decreases to low values during drying and storage. During malt production considerable changes in the prevailing growth conditions mark another fundamental change in the fungal commu-nity of the barley grain. High water activities during steeping and high carbon dioxide concentrations during subsequent germination are ideally suited for growth of quite selective species such as Alter-naria spp., Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium avenaceum, F. graminearum, F. culmorum and F. tricinctum from inside the grain or Geotrichum candidum, Mucor mucedo, Rhizopus oryzae and Rhizopus stolonifer as well as various white and red yeast species on the surface of the grain. Kilning of malt results in heat denaturation of most of the microbiota present on  germinated  barley.  Accordingly,  the  fungal community undergoes another change in which fast-growing  and  strongly  sporulating  Zygomy-cetes such as Rhizopus ssp. and Mucor spp. as well as yeasts and yeast-like fungi such as Geotrichum candidum  and  Ramichloridium  schulzeri  strongly develop under the conditions whereas other mem-bers of the typical malting flora are inactivated and eventually killed.
Table 8.1 shows an overview of the spectrum of species frequently encountered on raw barley seeds from the author’s own research using culture-based microbiological   analysis   (mycological   status). For the analysis, grains are surface disinfected by immersing them in a sodium hypochlorite solution (1% active chlorine) for 10 minutes before washing them twice with sterile tap water. One hundred seeds (five per plate) are plated to SNA medium (Nirenberg, 1976; Nirenberg, 1981) containing streptomycin  and  aureomycin  for  inhibition  of bacterial  growth  and  2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) for repression of seed germination. Fungal identification is performed after 14 days of incubation at 17°C in a 12 hours dark/light rhythm
with a mixture of white light and UV360nm  light.
Light microscopy of the mycelia growing from the seeds is performed at 100-fold magnification directly into the open agar plates. Results show that only a small number of species occur regularly and with relatively high numbers of contaminated seeds per sample. Examples for this group of fungi

are Alternaria spp., Epicoccum nigrum, and Fusarium tricinctum which can be found in nearly all samples with relatively low variation in their individual contamination rates. Other species such as Botrytis cinerea, Cladosporium herbarum, Bipolaris sorokini-ana, Fusarium avenaceum, F. equiseti, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, F. poae, Microdochium majus and M. nivale and red yeasts do regularly occur but their numbers show a much higher variation between samples and between years analysed. Others are found unregularly in some years on a varying per-centage of samples but fail to be found in others. The spectrum of species detected with the method described above is much more restricted as com-pared to the spectrum published by Noots et al. (1999). However, it has to be realized that the list of species given in that publication was compiled from the literature and has to be interpreted as the maximum of contamination potentially occurring on a sample of barley. The list of species provided by Flannigan (1969) as a compilation of species occurring on barley seeds with and without surface disinfection  and  after  incubation  under  various conditions of media and temperature shows much more similarity with the spectrum of species given in Table 8.1. The routine use of surface disinfection

and the incubation under fairly low temperatures may provide an explanation for the low numbers of Aspergillus and Penicillium species as well as the low counts and incidence of other typical surface con-taminants. In fact, the method used to set up Table 8.1 favours the detection of typical species of field fungi such as Alternaria, Bipolaris, Cladosporium, Epicoccum, Fusarium or Microdochium, which can invade deeper layers of the cereal grain and can thus escape  being  killed  during  surface  disinfection. The reason for applying a method that strongly selects for field fungi rather than a broader species spectrum by this author is the connection between Fusarium contamination of barley and wheat and the occurrence of gushing in beers produced from such contaminated malt. Niessen et al. (1992) dem-onstrated a correlation between the percentage of grains in a sample that are contaminated with either Fusarium graminearum, F. cerealis or F. culmorum and the potential of a sample of barley or wheat to cause gushing. Authors set up a maximum level at 3% of grains contaminated by the sum of any of the three species above. It appeared that samples in which this contamination level was exceeded almost always caused gushing in the gushing test described by Donhauser et al. (1990).

Fungal Contamination of Barley and Malt |  205


Problems related to fungal contamination of brewing cereals and malt
Barley grains provide a rich source of nutrients for all kinds of microorganisms. According to Gupta et al. (2010), whole barley grain contains about 65% (w/w) to 68% starch, 10% to 17% protein, 4% to 9% β-glucan, 2% to 3% free lipids, and 1.5% to 2.5% minerals with a percentage of total dietary fibre (DF) ranging from 11% to 34% and soluble DF within a range of 3% to 20%. However, most of this richness can only be explored if an organism’s tool-box is ready to provide appropriate enzymes and transporters necessary to break down polymeric substrates into monomers and to transport these monomers properly into the cell for further meta-bolic processing. Also, the presence of catabolic and anabolic pathways must be present in a fungus in order to generate energy and cellular matter from the substrate. This is the reason why the microbial community of raw barley grains is strongly domi-nated by those fungal species that are able to exploit the developing seed with its starchy endosperm and  its  protein-rich  aleuronic  layers.  Fungi  of lesser dominance as well as yeasts and bacteria are characterized by their ability to use only deposited organic matter and the few exudations of the hull or the husk that will not allow for excessive growth. Moreover, the decreasing water activity occurring during maturation of the seeds has a greatly adverse effect on all microorganisms present. Many species will expire from drying out and only those species will survive which have developed mechanisms to counter the conditions, e.g. formation of survival structures such as spores and chlamydospores or accumulation of compatible solutes in vegetative structures. Organisms such as Aspergillus glaucus, A. penicillioides, Eurotium amstelodami, E. chevalieri, E. repens, E. rubrum, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. brevicompactum, P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, P. crus-tosum, P. glabrum and Wallemia sebi are ubiquitous species that grow particularly well under reduced
water activities between aw 0.72 and aw 0.80.
The following three sections deal with the three principal problems related to the fungal contamina-tion of brewing cereals and derived malt.

Yield reduction
Yield reduction due to fungal contamination of barley  grains  (see  introduction)  can  result  via


different mechanisms. Fungi such as Microdochium nivale, Fusarium graminearum and other seed-borne and soil-borne fungal plant diseases can result in conditions such as seedling blight or damping off of seedlings, leading to retarded germination of the seedling, which is eventually killed prematurely. This effect will decrease the number of plants grow-ing per unit area, leading to a yield reduction as compared to a reference area with healthy plants. Aside from being seed-borne, the above-mentioned pathogens, as well as a variety of others, can also have a devastating effect when present in the soil to which sound barley has been sown (soil-borne).
Once  germinated  without  microbial  attack, the young barley plant develops into the flower-ing state where it becomes vulnerable to fungal attacking mechanisms that aim at either the glumes or anthers and gynoecium of individual spikelets or at the spike’s rachis. Glume infection is mainly by entering of the germination tubes of airborne spores into the stomata with subsequent dispersal of the fungus into the glume tissue and, later on, into  the  developing  endosperm  (Pritsch  et  al., 2000; Xu, 2003). Fungal infection via anthers and the  gynoecium  apparatus  depends  strongly  on the presence of appropriate climatic conditions during flowering, i.e. a period of high humidity and medium temperatures in order to establish infection.  Provided  the  prevalence  of  optimum conditions over 24–48 hours post infection, growth of cereal pathogens through the anther tissue into the ovaries of the developing seed can lead to deep seated infection of the endosperm, eventually kill-ing the young embryo or establishing seed-borne infection. Growth in species such as F. graminearum was found to be highly stimulated by the presence of choline and betaine, which are typically present in cereal anthers in high concentrations (Strange et al., 1974). Deep-seated infections will strongly reduce grain development and grain filling, result-ing in small and often shrivelled grain with a strong diminution in grain yield. Spread of fungal infec-tion from single spikelets to the rachis may result in cutting off the water supply for spikelets above the point of the primary infection. Affected spikelets will ripen early and show symptoms of head blight with grains showing strong reduction in size and filling. All symptoms described cause a reduction in thousand-kernel weight, i.e. reduced yield.
A   third   mechanism   responsible   for   yield
206 |  Niessen


reduction due to fungal infection is the lowering of assimilative leaf area. Fungal pathogens such as Ery-siphe graminis (powdery mildew), Puccinia hordei (brown rust, Scholes and Farrar, 1986), Septoria tritici and Rhynchosporium secalis (leaf blotch of wheat and barley, respectively, Fowler and Owen, 1971) or Pyrenophora teres (net blotch of barley, Evans,  1969)  strongly  reduce  the  assimilative capacity of cereal plants, resulting in reduction of grain filling and overall yield.

Fungal enzymatic activity
Fungi are an important source of enzymes for the brewing industry, both as producers of the generic enzymes (Østergaard and Olsen, 2011) and as a host for the transgenic production of non-fungal industrial enzymes (Olempska-Beer et al., 2006). Fungal enzymes are useful as additives to enhance hydrolysis during mashes involving partial or sole addition of raw cereals (Bajomo and Young, 1993) or  cereal  adjuncts  (Linko  et  al.,  1998)  and  to enhance filterability of wort for mashes of less than fully modified malt. By contrast, fungal enzymatic activity can have quite negative effects if developed as natural contaminants through the endogenous fungal community of barley and malt. Fungi were estimated to make up approximately 0.1% of the microbial biomass present on or in naturally con-taminated cereal grains (Van Nierop et al., 2006). Fungal  enzymatic  activity  has  repeatedly  been linked to poor quality of cereals and malt e.g. insuf-ficient malt modification, malt yield reduction, or reduction of diastatic power of malts (Van Nierop et al., 2006). Such mycobiota-associated modification of the malt parameters may, among other things, result in abnormal fermentation, intensification of wort and beer colour, gushing of beer, off taste and off flavour (Spicher, 1989). Information available on fungal enzymes produced and excreted by fungi in or on cereal grains is limited to the few species showing the most deleterious effects on the com-modity, i.e. Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum, Alternaria spp., Drechslera spp. It can, however, be assumed that excretion of any amylolytic, pro-teolytic or lipolytic fungal enzyme has a potential to modify the composition of cereal grains and, in turn, may potentially influence the quality of the cereal raw material used in malt production and beer fermentation. Changes that occur range from complete decomposition of components to

various degrees of chemical modification. Also, the colour and odour of mould-contaminated barley and malt may be negatively influenced by enzy-matic activity, especially when the grain is stored under suboptimum conditions (Christensen and Kaufmann, 1965). Fungi have been demonstrated to produce cellulases (Hoy et al., 1981), xylanases, β-glucanases,  and  proteases  during  infection  of barley and other cereals (Schwarz et al., 2002). These authors detected an increase in β-glucanase, xylanase, and protease activities in barley grain and in barley malt upon inoculation with Fusarium graminearum and F. poae, respectively. It was con-cluded that the enzymes were of fungal origin and that their activity levels appear to be such that they may affect the quality of the malt and the wort produced from it. The quality of beer produced from such worts is also affected. Fungal proteases play an important role here since they have con-siderable influence on the protein concentration and its composition in the grain and in products made therefrom (Nightingale et al., 1999). Fungal proteases produced by Fusarium spp., which belong to the so-called Fusarium head blight complex of species, have been particularly well characterized. Pekkarinen et al. (2003) detected several alkaline proteases in barley samples after field infection with  Fusarium  species.  The  presence  of  these proteases correlated well with the degradation of barley grain storage proteins (C- and D-hordeins) in the infested grains. Moreover, Hecht and Hippeli (2007) postulated the presence of a heat-stable pro-tease and its degradation of the beer foam protein nsLtp1 as a major cause for beer gushing since they observed considerably lower concentrations of the foam protein in gushing beers as compared to non-gushing beers.
Activity of fungal xylanases and glucanases has been suspected as the major reason for the presence of factors leading to premature yeast flocculation (PYF) during beer fermentation. Van Nierop et al. (2004) postulated that degradation of the malt husk arabinoxylan by fungal enzymes produces poly-saccharides of suficient size to cross-link yeast cell lectins resulting in flocculation and precipitation of fermenting yeast at still high sugar concentrations. Resultant beers are of low quality since they have high sugar contents and low end-of-fermentation cell counts (Verstrepen et al., 2003).
Fungal lipases play a major role as pathogenicity
Fungal Contamination of Barley and Malt |  207


factors in many plant pathogenic fungi but have also great importance in biotechnology (Subramoni et al., 2010). Secretion of lipases by F. graminearum has been demonstrated as a virulence factor during the infection of cereals (Voigt et al., 2005).
In  response  to  the  secretion  of  fungal  lytic enzymes, the plant reacts by changing its meta-bolic and gene expression profile (Geddes et al., 2008) and by producing antimicrobial substances to defend itself against attack (van Nierop, 2006). Besides a battery of enzymes that may directly attack microbial cells (β-1,3-glucanases, chitinases, proteases), the products of some enzymes (per-oxidases, oxalate oxidase, ammonia lyase) may have adverse effects on microorganisms as well (van Loon et al., 2006). Moreover, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Sels et al., 2008), which are antimicrobial peptides including the thionins, plant defensins, hevein- and knottin-like proteins and non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTP), have been identi-fied as having antifungal properties (Selitrennikoff, 2001). Interestingly, the heat-denatured and glyco-sylated form of the latter protein is supposed to be one of the major foam-stabilizing proteins in beer (Douliez et al., 2000) and its degradation by fungal proteases has been discussed as a causative agent of beer gushing (Hippeli and Elstner, 2002).

Fungal secondary metabolites
Secondary metabolites are distinguished from pri-mary metabolites that are produced and distributed almost universally by the intermediary metabolism of  living  organisms.  Secondary  metabolites  are often bioactive, usually of low molecular weight, and are produced as families of related compounds at restricted stages in the life cycle, with production often being correlated with a specific stage in the fungal development or morphological differentia-tion (Calvo et al., 2002). Secondary metabolites are dispensable for the producing fungus and have restricted taxonomic distribution with only a small group  of  organisms  producing  each  metabolite (Bennett and Bentley, 1989; Keller et al., 2005). Filamentous fungi produce an enormous variety of secondary metabolites in pure culture but also when growing on natural substrates such as brew-ing  cereals  and  malt.  Nielsen  and  Smedsgaard (2003)  provided  a  list  of  474  individual  and structurally well-characterized substances isolated

from extracts of pure liquid cultures of filamentous fungi. To date, the most recent version (2012) of the  AntiBase  database  (Wiley-VCH,  Weinheim, Germany) used for the LC-MS based identifica-tion of microbial secondary compounds contains 3000 fungal secondary metabolites (Klitgaard et al., 2014). However, this number is likely to represent only a fraction of the total secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi. Fungal secondary metabolites can have a diversity of physiological and ecological functions (Vining 1990) but in the majority of cases their functions are obscure. How-ever, it can be assumed that they are bound to play an important role in the fungal life cycle and in the interaction with the environment since their production  is  highly  regulated  and  complex  in most cases. Regulatory links between secondary metabolism, light and sexual/asexual reproduction have been established, which might explain their function to a wider extent (Fox and Howlet, 2008).

Antimicrobials
Antimicrobials such as the antibacterial penicillins, cephalosporins and other β-lactam antibiotics, the antiprotozoal  trypacidin,  the  antibacterial  enni-atins (fusafungin), the bacteriostatic fusidic acid (fucidin,  ramycin)  or  the  antifungals  cerulenin, cordycepin, siccanin and viridian, just to name a few, are produced by filamentous fungi to cope with other microorganisms competing for nutrients and space. Many of them have been used in modern medicine but some can also be harmful to humans and animals. Similar observations can be made regarding fungal pigments. The red discoloration often  observed  in  Fusarium-infected  barley  and malt results from bikaverin and norbikaverin pro-duction by many species in the genus (Wieman et al., 2009). However, those pigments also have antimicrobial properties against certain protozoa and fungi (Limón et al., 2010). Also, compounds such as the naphtho-γ-pyrones aurofusarin and rubrofusarin, which are responsible for the intense red to violet pigmentation of many Fusarium spp., have mycotoxin properties but are nonetheless an interesting  subject  for  pharmacological  research due to their anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, anti-can-cer, anti-HIV, anti-hyperuricuric, anti-tubercular, or mammalian triacylglycerol synthesis inhibitive activities (Choque et al., 2015).

Pigments
Melanins,  the  pigments  mainly  responsible  for black discoloration of weathered barley and malt after infection with dematiaceous fungi such as Alternaria spp. and Drechslera spp., are anti-stress compounds  with  antioxidant  abilities  but  also function as virulence factors during invasion of the host plant (Henson et al., 1999). Other fungal pig-ments seem to have no known adverse effects and their exploitation as natural colorants in the food industry is hence intensively studied (Durán et al., 2002; Mapari et al., 2005, 2010).

Fungal hormones
Fungal hormones are a group of secondary metabo-lites to which a function can clearly be attributed. They are produced by cells as very specific mol-ecules that have morphogenetic effects on other cells of the same or closely related species and are aimed at regulating and coordinating the temporal and spatial sequence of events leading to the pair-ing and fusion of nuclei of two cells during sexual reproduction (see reviews by Gooday, 1974 and by Gooday and Davis, 1993). The mechanism of selec-tive attraction of mating partners may involve the mutual production of compounds binding specifi-cally to hormone receptors on or in the respective partner and triggering the morphogenetic differ-entiations leading to sexual reproduction like in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  (Herskowitz,  1988).  In other  species,  one  of  the  two  mating  partners produces a hormone that triggers morphogenetic differentiation in the other. Production of anther-idiol in the water mould Achlya spp. would be an example for this type (Gooday, 1974). The third type of mechanism is the mutual production of two different precursors by each mating partner, which mutually  supplements  a  biosynthetic  pathway in the respective mating partners resulting in the production of a compound that triggers the forma-tion of mating organs in both partners. This type of mechanism can be found in the Mucorales such as in Mucor spp. or Rhizopus spp. (Werkman and van den Ende, 1974).

Mycotoxins
Several overviews of the history of mycotoxins in food and feed, including cereals and malt, as well as coverage of their impact on human and animal health and on the economy have been published

in the past (Kampelmacher, 1973; Charmley et al., 1995; D’Mello and MacDonald, 1997; Hussein and Brasel, 2001; Richard, 2007; Bhat et al., 2010; Zain, 2011). Despite the wide variety of substances that fall into the category of mycotoxins (about 400), the number of compounds present in substrates for human consumption and consumption by livestock is relatively limited (≈30). This is due to the fact that the majority of compounds are intermedi-ates of known mycotoxins so far described only in lab cultures. Under natural conditions, however, they are converted to one of the major compo-nents found regularly in food products. Most of the known mycotoxins produced on cereals and malt come from species within the ascomycete-ous genera Alternaria, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium. However, also species in Acremonium (crotocin),  Chaetomium  (chaetoglobosin,  coch-liodinol),  Eurotium  (xanthocillin),  Stachybotrys (roridin, satratoxins, trichoverrins and trichover-rols, verrucarin), Trichoderma (trichodermin) or Trichothecium   (trichothecin)   may   infrequently grow in cereal seeds and can produce the mycotox-ins shown in parentheses. The following sections give an overview of the mycotoxins that have been reported to occur in brewing cereals, malt or beer. Information on legal limits for the mycotoxins in different countries of the world were taken from a survey published by the FAO (2004). More back-ground information on legal limits for mycotoxins in the EU and in the USA can be found on the homepage of the German Society for Mycotoxin Research www.mycotoxin.de/.

Toxins of Aspergillus and Penicillium in beer production

Aflatoxins
Aflatoxins are produced by a group of 14 differ-ent species in three sections of the fungal genus Aspergillus,  i.e.  sections  Flavi,  Nidulantes,  and Ochraceorosei (Varga et al., 2009). Aflatoxins are known  as  the  most  potent  carcinogens  among natural products. They act as acute liver toxicants and trigger liver carcinomas in addition to impair-ing respiration, renal and gastrointestinal function, and the nervous and immune systems in humans and animals (Coulombe, 1994). Owing to its high toxicological potential, the compound and its deriv-atives are regulated in most countries worldwide
Fungal Contamination of Barley and Malt |  209


(van Egmond and Jonker, 2005; van Egmond et al., 2007). Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are the species that occur on brewing cereals and brewing adjuncts and aflatoxins have been isolated from barley and malt in different parts of the world (Park et al., 2002; Mateo et al., 2011). However, contami-nation of beer in most cases resulted from the use of contaminated maize grits rather than from cereal malt (Pietri et al., 2010). Due to its low water solu-bility, only a small proportion of the initial aflatoxin concentration is transmitted into the final beer so that its occurrence in the product is rather an excep-tion, at least in Europe and in Northern America (Mably et al., 2005; Bertuzzi et al., 2011; Burdaspal and Legarda, 2013).

Citrinin
Citrinin is an isocoumarin (pentaketide) myco-toxin produced by some Penicillium species, i.e. P. citrinum, P. expansum, P. radicicola and P. verrucosum as well as Monascus ruber (Samson et al. 2010; Ostry et al., 2013). P. verrucosum has been identi-fied as the major producer of the toxin in barley where it mostly co-occurs together with the struc-turally related mycotoxin ochratoxin A (see below) (Krogh et al., 1973; Hökby et al.,1979; Domoglou et al. 1984; Vrabcheva et al., 2000). Biosynthesis of both mycotoxins uses a common isocoumarin moiety precursor (Larsen et al., 2001) and it has recently been established that one toxin will be produced at the expense of the other depending on the prevailing environmental conditions (Schmidt-Heydt et al., 2015).
Citrinin is nephrotoxic (Krogh et al., 1970) and teratogenic (Reddy et al., 1982) in mammals and has been found to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis (Endo and Kuroda, 1976). Since it usually occurs together with ochratoxin A, a participation in the development of porcine nephropathy and human Balkan  endemic  nephropathy  (BEN)  has  been discussed (Vrabcheva et al., 2000). Krogh et al. (1974) established that citrinin is unstable under the conditions prevailing during mashing and will therefore not be transmitted into the final beer, though Ikalafeng et al. (2013) reported the pres-ence of the toxin at elevated levels in traditionally brewed indigenous beers in South Africa.

Cyclopiazonic acid
Production of cyclopiazonic acid has been found in cultures of Aspergillus flavus, A. oryzae, Penicillium

camemberti, P. commune, P. dipodomyicola, P. gri-seofulvum, and P. palitans (Frisvad et al., 2004; Samson et al., 2010). The toxin is uncommon in brewing cereals and malt but has been detected in maize after infection with P. commune, A. flavus and A. orzyzae as a co-contaminant, together with aflatoxins (Gqaleni et al., 1996). No published reports on the compound as a contaminant of beer are available. Owing to structural similarities, symptoms of toxicity encountered in laboratory animals after administration of cyclopiazonic acid were very similar to aflatoxin toxicosis, i.e. hepa-totoxic, nephrotoxic, neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects. So far no legal limits have been adopted for cyclopiazonic acid.

Ochratoxin A (OTA)
Ochratoxin A is produced in cultures of Petromyces alliaceus,  Aspergillus  carbonarius,  A.  niger  group species, A. ochraceus, A. steynii, A. westerdijkeae, P. nordicum and P. verrucosum (Samson et al., 2010). P. verrucosum has been identified as the major pro-ducer of the toxin in brewing barley where it mostly co-occurs together with the structurally related iso-coumarine mycotoxin citrinin (see above) (Krogh et al., 1973; Hökby et al., 1979; Vrabcheva et al., 2000). Contamination of maize kernels is regularly due to infection with A. carbonarius, A. niger, and A. ochraceus, depending on the origin of the tested materials (Magnoli et al., 2006, 2007). The toxin has been detected in various food products such as cereal products, nuts, coffee, cocoa, wine, grape juice, vegetables, dried fruits and spices. It has been demonstrated to contaminate a high percentage of beer samples although in low concentrations (Visconti et al., 2000; Tangni et al., 2002; Medina et al., 2005; Varga et al., 2005; Bellver Soto et al., 2014). Concentration of the compound has been shown to decrease considerably during mashing and during the brewing process so that 2% to 25% of the original OTA amounts were recovered from the final beer (Krogh et al., 1974; Chu et al., 1975). Ochratoxin A is nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, immuno-toxic, teratogenic and genotoxic (Petzinger and Ziegler, 2000) and has been classified a B2 cancer compound by the IARC (1993). Classification into the group of probably carcinogenic compounds (2A) has been proposed (Kuiper-Goodman, 1996). While the induction of cancer is not proven in humans there are clear indications of a connection to BEN (Vrabcheva et al., 2000). Legal limits for

the contamination of food and food raw materials with OTA are in effect in many countries, including the EU, with maximum values ranging from 2.0 to 20µg/kg in different food sources (van Egmond, 2007). A limit of 0.2µg/kg has been set up for beer by the European Commission.

Patulin and penicillic acid
Patulin is a lactone compound that can be produced by cultures of A. clavatus, Byssochlamys nivea, P. carneum, P. expansum, P. griseofulvum, P. paneum and P. sclerotigenum whereas the structurally related compound penicillic acid is produced by strains of A. ochraceus, A. steynii, A. westerdijkiae, P. auranti-ogriseum, P. cyclopium, P. freii, P. melanoconidium, P. polonicum and P. viridicatum. Among the spe-cies listed above, A. clavatus has been frequently isolated from malted barley and from malt dust. Patulin and penicillic acid have cytotoxic proper-ties  (Schaeffer  et  al.,  1975).  Both  compounds induce DNA strand breaks and inhibition of DNA synthesis (Stĕtina and Votava, 1986). Inhibition of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase plays a significant role in the observed toxicological effects (Arafat et al., 1985). The carcinogenicity of patulin is cur-rently under investigation and induction of skin tumours  after  superficial  application  of  patulin have been discussed (Saxena et al., 2011). Penicillic acid often occurs together with OTA in food and feed materials. Neither patulin nor penicillic acid has been found in beer yet. However, this is not due to their absence from the brewing process but rather to their denaturation during the fermenta-tion process (Inoue et al., 2013). Patulin is actively decomposed to non-toxic ascladiol E and ascladiol Z by brewing yeast under fermentative conditions (Moss and Long, 2002). Because of its suspected carcinogenicity, legal regulations for patulin exist in various countries (FAO, 2004), including the EU. Maximum legal values vary between 20 and 50µg/ kg and are almost always related to consumption of apple products rather than cereals.

Sterigmatocystin
Production of sterigmatocystin has recently been found to be a widely distributed trait in various genera within the Pezizomycotina. Sterigmatocystin can be produced by strains of species within genera Emericella, Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Botryotrichum

and Humicola (Rank et al., 2011) with A. versicolor being the main producer of the toxin in cereals. The toxin can be found in a variety of food sources such as cheese, fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, green coffee, rice, maize, cereals and cereal products. Veršilovskis et al. (2008a) detected sterigmatocystin in about 25% of grain samples from Latvia and were able to show that it occurs also in a low percentage of local beers (Veršilovskis et al., 2008b). It can be anticipated that the toxin will occur in grain from countries other than Latvia as well. The fact that several advanced techniques have been established recently for the sensitive detection and quanti-fication of sterigmatocystin in cereals may point to elevated awareness towards the problem (see Hossain and Goto, 2015; Sasaki et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014). The furofuran (dekaketide) toxin occurs as an intermediate during aflatoxin biosynthesis in laboratory cultures of typical aflatoxin producers (A. flavus. A. parasiticus) but is formed as a meta-bolic end product by these species. According to its structural similarity with aflatoxins, sterigmatocys-tin is also supposed to be closely related in regard to its toxicology. No legal limits have been set up yet (FAO, 2004) but the substance should be treated in a way similar to that of aflatoxins.

Fusarium toxins in beer production

Trichothecenes
Trichothecenes are the biggest group of chemically related compounds among the mycotoxins. These sesquiterpenes are produced in cultures of several different species belonging to the Fusarium sections Discolor, Gibbosum, Sporotrichiella and Arthrospori-ella.   Moreover,   production   of   trichothecene derivatives   (macrocyclic   trichothecenes)   was found in species from genera Trichoderma, Myrothe-cium, Cephalosporium, Stachybotrys, Cladosporium, Trichothecium, Verticimonosporium and Spicellum as well as in the leaves of the Brazilian shrub Baccharis megapotamica (Jarvis et al., 1991). Trichothecenes occur in all kinds of cereals and food product made therefrom, including malt and beer as well as in vegetables and fruits but also in materials such as building materials, textiles or in the air (spores of Stachybotrys chartarum). According to their chemi-cal structure, all trichothecenes can be categorized into  four  basic  types,  i.e.  8-keto-trichothecenes
Fungal Contamination of Barley and Malt |  211


(type  A),  8-hydroxy-trichothecenes  (type  B), di-epoxythrichothecenes (C) and macrocyclic tri-chothecenes (type D) (see McCormick et al., 2011). Compounds belonging to type A and type B are the most common in cereals and cereal products (Rod-riguez-Carrasco et al., 2013). The trichothecenes most  commonly  detected  in  wheat  and  barley grown in different geographic regions are the type B trichothecenes deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated derivatives 3-acetyl DON and 15-acetyl DON, nivalenol (NIV), and fusarenone-X (FX) as well as the type A trichothecenes T2-toxin, HT2-toxin, and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) (Barthel et al., 2012; Ibáñez-Vea et al., 2012; Rasmussen et al., 2012; Tittlemier et al., 2013).
Several of the trichothecenes have been found to conjugate with sugars to form glycosides, masking their detection during routine analytical proce-dures (Berthiller et al., 2013). However, the toxins can readily be released from their glycosidic partner by microbial activity in the human or animal gut to display their full toxicity (Dall’Erta et al., 2013). Assessment of the toxicological potential of regu-lated trichothecenes such as DON in a sample may therefore be underestimated if only concentrations of the parent toxins are measured during routine analysis.  Transfer  of  deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON-3-Glc) from barley through malting and the brewing process was observed with a steady increase of DON-3-Glc resulting in an excess of the glucoside over the free form of the toxin in the final beer (Lancova et al., 2008; Kostelanska et al., 2009). Recently, Zachariasova et al. (2012) observed the presence of DON-3-oligoglucosides of varying chain length in addition to the monoglu-coside and the unmodified DON in malt and beer, showing that trichothecene analysis may become a more complex task in the future.
The fate of DON as the most widely distrib-uted Fusarium mycotoxin has been studied using immunochemical (Niessen and Donhauser, 1993) or HPLC-based analysis (Kostelanska et al., 2011). Studies revealed that a considerable proportion of DON is washed away from a field contaminated sample during steeping (Beattie et al., 1998). How-ever, levels of the toxin increased during the malting process due to de novo synthesis, adding up to the concentrations already present inside barley grains from field contamination. Most of the toxin was transferred to the wort and no reduction was found

during wort boiling, fermentation and ripening so that the finished beer had similarly high concen-trations as compared to the corresponding malt (Lancova et al., 2008). It was most interesting to see that final concentrations of ‘masked’ DON gly-cosides were higher than the unmasked derivative.
Rocha et al. (2005) reviewed the toxicologi-cal effects and underlying cellular mechanisms of the most common trichothecene mycotoxins in mammals and in plants. Acute symptoms of tri-chothecene uptake are diarrhoea (Matsuoka and Kubota, 1987), vomiting (Ishii et al., 1975), impair-ment of the immune system, reduced performance of the heart muscle, disorder of the nervous system and skin irritations (see Beasly, 1989). Acute toxic aleukia (ATA, Joffe, 1971), the Kashin-Beck disease (Joffe, 1986; Kolsteren, 1992) and the red mould disease (Yoshizawa, 1983) have been described as human conditions that are associated with tri-chothecenes.
Legal limits have been set for the trichothecenes deoxynivalenol and T2-toxin in several countries worldwide, including the EU, Canada, Russia, and the USA (FAO, 2004). Moreover, a few countries have additional regulations for HT-2 toxin and diacetoxyscirpenol in certain food and feed com-modities. Although more toxic than DON, NIV concentrations have undergone no legal regulation yet. However, the toxin might need to be given more attention from a legal perspective in the future (European Commission, 2002).

Fumonisins
Fumonisins comprise a group of structurally simi-lar polyketide mycotoxins. They have been found to be produced by several of the >34 species within the Gibberella fujikuroi complex (GFC) of Fuarium species (Kvas et al., 2009), e.g. F. fujikuroi, F. globo-sum, F. proliferatum, F. nygamai, F. subglutinans and F. verticillioides (Proctor et al., 2004). Outside this group of closely related species, fumonisins have been found to be produced in some strains of F. oxysporum  and,  surprisingly,  in  Aspergillus  niger (Frisvad et al., 2007) and in biotechnologically important species within the fungal genus Toly-pocladium (Mogensen et al., 2011). Whilst the most common fumonisin in Fusarium spp. is fumonisin
B1, A. niger strains produce fumonisins B2, B4 and
B6 (Månsson et al., 2010; Mogensen et al., 2010).
Fumonisins have rarely been detected as natural
212 |  Niessen


contaminants of barley or wheat (Stanković et al., 2012). However, they can be detected in beers on a regular basis (Soriano and Dragacci, 2004; Bertuzzi et al., 2011). Similar to aflatoxins, it can therefore be assumed that maize-based brewing adjuncts will be the major source of fumonisin contamination
in beer. Beside fumonisin B1, which is typically produced by Fusarium spp., fumonisin B2 has been
found in beer also, obviously produced by A. niger contamination. Other fumonisins from that source,
FB4, and FB6, have not been found in beer yet,
but can be anticipated in the product. Moreover, fumonisins can be regularly found in traditional African beers brewed from sorghum and maize (Nkwe et al., 2005; Shephard et al., 2005). Pietri et al. (2010) demonstrated that about half of the fumonisin present in contaminated brewing raw materials can be transferred through the brewing process. This is a much higher percentage as com-pared to aflatoxin, most of which is bound to spent grains and eliminated from the brewing process.
Fumonsin B1 has the highest toxicity among this
group of compounds (Musser and Plattner, 1997). It is neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, and nephrotoxic in animals, and it has been classified as a possible carcinogen  to  humans  (Stockmann-Juvala  and Savolainen, 2008). Major mechanisms of toxicity are related to the structural similarities between sphingolipids  and  fumonisins,  which  interfere with ceramide synthase and lead to accumulation of sphinganine in cells and tissues. A correlation between high fumonisin concentrations in the diets of people in parts of China (Yoshizawa et al., 1994) and south African Transkei (Sydenham et al., 1990) with the occurrence of oesophageal cancer has been suspected.
The European Commission has set legal limits for fumonisins in certain food stuffs ranging from
200µg/kg to 4000µg/kg for the sum of FB1  and FB2  (European Commission, 2006). Many coun-
tries, which take reference to the EU legislation, such as Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Norway and Switzerland, have established similar maxi-mum limits for fumonisins. In the international markets, however, no specific maximum limits for fumonisins are established in major markets includ-ing China, Japan, India, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Russia, Canada and many Latin American countries.

Emerging mycotoxins: moniliformin, fusaproliferin, enniatins and beauvericin Emerging mycotoxins are considered as less impor-tant in comparison to ‘classical’ mycotoxins since they are probably not of acute toxicity. However, their high prevalence in foodstuffs in occasionally high concentrations (up to mg/kg) warrants an assessment of their importance for food safety. No legal limits have been set up so far for any of the emerging mycotoxins.
Moniliformin is a 1-hydroxycyclobutene 3,4-dione mycotoxin produced by various Fusarium spp. (F. acuminatum, F. avenaceum, F. oxysporum, F. subglutinans, F. tricinctum, F. verticillioides) on substrates such as maize, rice, cereals and millet. Natural contamination has been observed in low concentrations in wheat and barley mainly grown in Scandinavian countries (Jestoi et al., 2004; Uhlig et al., 2004) but was found to be at quite high levels in maize (Sharman et al., 1991; Lew et al., 1996). Whilst the toxin may be present in barley and malt and in even higher concentrations in maize-based brewing adjuncts, it has never been detected in beer. However, according to experiments performed by Pineda-Valdes and Bullerman (2010) moniliformin is fairly stable under the pH and temperature condi-tions prevailing during mashing. As a consequence, the fate of the toxin during the brewing process should be elucidated in future studies. Data on the toxicity of moniliformin is scarce and has been reviewed by Jestoi (2008). It was suspected to be involved in the development of human oesophageal cancer, possibly interacting with fumonisins. The relationship between moniliformin and a human cardiomyopathy  known  as  the  Keshan  disease has been suggested (Zhao, 1993). Inhibition of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase by the toxin in the myocardium seems to play an important role in the condition (Chen et al., 1990). Beauvericin and enniatins are cyclohexadepsi-peptides produced by several species in the genus Fusarium (see Kulik et al., 2007 for list of species) as well as by the entomopathogenic fungal species Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium hemipterigenum and by the mangrove fungus Halosarpheia sp. Sev-eral chemically different enniatins (A, A1, B, B1, B2, B3, B4, D, E, F, G, H and I) and one beauvericin derivative have been described so far. Enniatins A and B were frequently isolated from wheat and

barley samples marketed in Spain (Meca et al., 2010), Morocco (Mahnine et al., 2011), Tunisia (Oueslati et al., 2011), and Norway (Uhlig et al., 2006). Recently, Bolechová et al. (2015) detected enniatins in all of 52 analysed barley and malt samples from the Czech Republic. Beauvericin has frequently been detected together with enniatins but its frequency of occurrence and the concen-trations found are generally lower. Both types of cyclodepsipeptides are produced via non-riboso-mal peptide synthesis using unique multifunctional enzymes, enniatin synthetase (Hornbogen et al., 2002) and beauvericin synthetase (Peeters et al., 1988). Recently, Hu et al. (2014) followed the fate of beauvericin and enniatins A, A1, B and B1 through the malting and brewing processes. Considerable amounts of all toxins were produced during  green  malt  production  with  a  similarly strong  decrease  after  kilning.  During  brewing, considerable amounts of the toxins were eliminated from the process with the spent grains and after adsorption to yeast cells (Vaclavikova et al., 2013). Whilst most of the toxins were eliminated, enni-atins and beauvericin were present in the final beer in detectable concentrations. Meca et al. (2013) report degradation rates between 23% and 82% for beauvericin during the brewing process, which means that considerable levels will be present in the final beer. Moreover, since spent grain and yeast are often used as animal feed, problems with the toxins may arise in downstream areas of beer production.
Knowledge  of  the  toxicology  of  enniatins and beauvercin is fragmentary and needs further elucidation. Both compounds were found to be cytotoxic (Calò et al., 2004) and antibiotic (Dobler et al., 1969). They act as ionophores in cell cultures leading to an inward calcium flux (Kamyar et al., 2004, 2006). Beside their toxic effects at higher concentrations, enniatins showed profound apop-tosis-inducing  effects  especially  against  various human cancer cell types at low micromolar con-centrations (Dornetshuber et al., 2007; Hyun et al., 2009).
Fusaproliferin  is  a  sesterterpene  mycotoxin, production of which has been reported by strains of different Fusarium spp. within the Gibberella fuji-kuroi complex, with F. anthophilum, F. guttiforme, F. proliferatum and F. subglutinans being the major producers (Fotso et al., 2002; Moretti et al., 2007). The compound has been frequently observed to

contaminate barley, wheat, maize and rice from dif-ferent climatic regions and to be co-occurring with
beauvericin and fumonisin B1, however with lower
frequency and concentrations (Ritieni et al., 1997; Meca et al., 2010; Zinedine et al., 2011). Rubert et al. (2011) detected no fusaproliferin in any of 25 commercial beers analysed for the toxin. Recently, Ezekiel et al. (2015) observed a 99.4% reduction of fusaproliferin concentrations during the pro-duction  of  kunu-zaki,  a  traditional  maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage produced in rural Nigeria. The result may indicate a behaviour simi-lar to that of beauvericin and enniatins, which are widely eliminated from the brewing process with spent grains and yeast (Vaclavicova et al., 2013).
Fusaproliferin is a teratogenic fungal metabolite that causes cephalic dichotomy, acrocephaly, and limb asymmetry in chicken embryos (Ritieni et al., 1997) and is toxic to IARC/LCL 171 human B lymphocytes (Logrieco et al., 1996). No human diseases have been connected with the toxin and no legal limits have been set up for it so far.

Alternaria toxins in beer production Alternaria toxins [alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl  ether  (AME),  altenuene  (ALT), altertoxins I, II, and III (ATX-I, -II, and -III), l-ten-uazonic acid (TeA), Alternaria alternata lycopersici toxin (AAL)] have been found to be produced by cultures of a wide variety of Alternaria spp., includ-ing A. alternata, A. solani, and A. tenuissima as well as Phoma sorghina and Pyricularia oryzae (Ostry, 2008). Producing species occur on a wide variety of host plants, including wheat and barley, under different climatic conditions. Alternaria toxins rep-resent four different groups of chemical structures: dibenzopyrone  derivatives  (AOH,  AME,  ALT), perylene derivatives (ATX-I, -II, -III), tetramic acid derivatives (TeA) and polyketides (AAL) (Bot-talico and Logrieco, 1998). Alternaria species are regularly found to contaminate barley and wheat grains with incidences of up to 90% in a sample. Several surveys have elucidated the spectrum of Alternaria toxins produced by pure cultures isolated from wheat and barley. However, there seems to be an absence of investigations regarding the incidence of Alternaria toxins in wheat, barley and malts made thereof. Mycotoxins from Alternaria spp. have been detected in weathered wheat from China (Li and Yoshizawa, 2000). Only recently Müller and Korn
214 |  Niessen


(2013) analysed German wheat over a period of 10 years and detected TeA in 30% of the samples with other Alternaria toxins being of lower frequency. When present in the malt, a considerable propor-tion of TeA seems to be transferred into the final beer as shown by Siegel et al. (2010a) who detected the toxin in 37 of 43 commercial beer samples in concentrations up to 175µg/kg. The same authors observed only minor degradation of AOH, AME, and ALT during bread baking which would hint that degradation might be rather low during mash-ing (Siegel et al., 2010b).
TeA has been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of mammalian cells. It has been used in vitro for the inhibition of human tumour cells (Kaczka et al. 1964). AME showed weak muta-genicity in the Ames test (Scott and Stoltz, 1980) and is teratogenic in tests with hamsters (Pollock et al., 1982). Alternariol is activated by exposure to light. Under the action of UV light, cross-linking of double-stranded DNA was observed (DiCosmo and Straus, 1985). Mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of Alternariol and AME and participa-tion in the development of laryngeal cancer in areas of China were suspected (Liu et al., 1992). No spe-cific limits or guidelines have been adopted for any of the Alternaria toxins.

Gushing
Gushing describes the spontaneous over foaming of a carbonated beverage upon opening of a bottle without previous agitation. The phenomenon has been observed in carbonated beverages such as beer (Christian et al., 2011; Fischer, 2001), cham-pagne (Kemp et al., 2015) or sparkling juice drinks (Schuhmacher, 2002). The phenomenon is caused by the presence of high concentrations of hydro-phobic  condensation  nuclei  at  which  dissolved carbon dioxide will instantly turn into the gas phase upon pressure release during opening of the bottle, forming gas-filled bubbles that grow fast and rise upwards, leading to overfoaming of the liquid (Pel-laud, 2002; Casey, 1996).
Gushing is a multicausal phenomenon and two types are commonly distinguished in regard to the causative factors involved (Amaha and Kitabatake 1981; Casey 1996). The term ‘secondary gushing’ is used for all technological factors, e.g. dust or other particulate matter, particles leaking from filter materials, or particulate calcium oxalate crystals

(Carrington et al., 1972), that cause introduction of nucleation particles into the bottled beverage. Secondary  factors  can  typically  be  handled  by modifying the brewing and filling process to result in exclusion of such particles or surfactants. Pri-mary type gushing is exclusively related to the use of malt or unmalted cereals that have been infected by certain fungi during growth in the field or in the malt house (Gjertsen and Trolle, 1963). Based on  assumptions  about  possible  structure/effect relationships, Hippeli and Elstner (2002) were the first to publish speculations on a possible role of hydrophobins as gushing inducers in beer. Authors were obviously unaware of the fact that Haikara et al. (1999) had filed a PCT patent (WO 99/54725) already in 1999 (with priority to a national Finnish patent from 1998) in which hydrophobins were used as indicators for gushing in carbonated bever-ages (Haikara et al., 1999). Today it has become a generally accepted doctrine that these extremely amphiphilic fungal proteins are responsible for the induction of primary gushing in beer (Sarlin et al., 2005a; Garbe et al., 2011; Specker, 2014).
Hydrophobins have been shown to be produced by a great variety of species within the filamentous fungi so that their production seems to be a general principle in that group (Talbot, 1997). One of their obvious natural functions is to decrease the surface tension of water by self-assembling at water/air interfaces, thus enabling transition of this barrier during the production of aerial mycelia (Wösten et al., 1999; Cox et al., 2007). Another role may be to establish proper contact between fungal cells and host tissue during plant infection (Wösten et al., 1994; Kim et al., 2005). All known proteins of that type share a common pattern of eight cysteines at conserved positions. Sequences between cysteines are however highly variable but the four-domain secondary structure always results in the formation of extremely amphiphilic proteins. Two subgroups of hydrophobins, class 1 and class 2, have been identified according to differences in spacing and sequence between cysteines, hydrophobicity pat-terns and solubility in organic solvents (Wessels et al., 1994). Among the few hydrophobins available in purified form from transgenic Pichia pastoris cultures only those belonging to class 2 have been shown to induce gushing (Stübner et al., 2010; Lutterschmid et al., 2011; Niu et al., 2012; Sarlin et al., 2012). Hydrophobins enter the barley-to-beer
Fungal Contamination of Barley and Malt |  215


chain upon use of fungal-contaminated brewing malt (Sarlin et al., 2007). Contaminations with Fusarium spp. such as F. graminearum, F. culmorum or F. poae have been found to be highly correlated with  gushing  induction  in  the  beer  produced (Gjertsen et al., 1965; Niessen et al., 1992; Schwarz et al., 1996; Sarlin et al., 2005b).
The  mechanism  of  action  of  hydrophobin-induced gushing as well as the way they interact with other promoting or inhibiting factors is still a matter of debate. Currently, a mechanism that is in accordance with the thermodynamic approach of the ‘nano-bomb’ theory described by Shokri-bousjein et al. (2011) and refined by Deckers et al. (2013) seems to provide many explanations for  the  phenomenon  observed  during  primary gushing. The theory is in line with observations about interactions found between hydrophobins and the regular beer foam proteins nsLtp1 and Z4 (Stübner et al., 2010; Specker et al., 2014) as well as their interaction with lipophilic hop components (Gardner et al., 1973; Lutterschmid et al., 2010; Müller et al., 2010; Shokribousjein et al., 2014). Hydrophobin layers fulfil the basic assumptions made in the varying permeability model (for a review see Pellaud, 2002). Simulation of molecular dynamics of carbon dioxide condensation resulted
in evidence for a clustering of CO2 molecules at the
hydrophobin’s hydrophobic patch, thus supporting
the interaction of CO2 and hydrophobins (Deck-
ers et al., 2012a). According to the nano-bomb theory,  small  particles  of  5–10nm  in  diameter
represent hydrophobin-coated CO2 micro-bubbles.
These develop during yeast fermentation, filling and shaking of bottles. At a critical diameter, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic monolayer hydrophobin film surrounding the bubble becomes imperme-able and further shrinkage is prevented according to the varying permeability model. The resulting nano-bubbles were calculated to possess an inter-nal pressure of about 4 bar (Deckers et al., 2010, 2012b). During opening of the bottle, the gas–liquid equilibrium between beer and the atmosphere is abruptly misbalanced and nano-bubbles present in
the beverage will expand explosively and CO2 from
the surrounding liquid phase will diffuse into the bubble leading to uncontrolled bubble growth (Pel-laud, 2002). The rapid expansion of micro bubbles provides the energy which is used to break bonds between CO2 and water molecules in the vicinity of

an expanding bubble, hence the name ‘nano bomb’.
This eventually forces CO2  molecules to transit
from the water-soluble state into the gas phase by free diffusion and formation of unstabilized sec-ondary gas bubbles that rise to the surface in masses resulting in gushing (Deckers et al., 2010).
The  model  recently  presented  by  Specker (2014) is in broad agreement with the nano-bomb model. However, this author demonstrated that addition of purified transgenic nsLtp1 to beer or carbonated water previously mixed with a gushing-inducing concentration of purified transgenic class 2 hydrophobin FcHyd5p from F. culmorum resulted in a significant decrease of gushing volumes com-pared with a nsLtp1-free control. Results obtained from atomic force microscopy analysis of mixed hydrophobin/nsLtp1 surface films suggested that nano-bubbles present in gushing beer may in fact be  surrounded  by  mixed  layers  of  amphiphilic proteins which tend to be more prone to disrup-tion than films of either pure protein. Moreover, the author deduced that formation of secondary
bubbles during gushing events comes from CO2
nucleation at the hydrophobic inner layers of now exposed fragments of the disrupted bubble skin.


Detection and identification of fungi and fungal metabolites in cereals, malt, and beer

Physical, chemical, and affinity-based methods
Visual and olfactory examination of ingredients for signs of fungal contamination has been the prin-cipal method of quality assessment since humans first made beer. Even today with the availability of advanced  instrumentation,  experienced  brewers and maltsters can recognize a low-quality barley or malt by its colour, smell and hand feel. Musty smells are an indication of attack by typical storage fungi, which in turn can be related to improper storage of barley or malt. Also, changes in grain colour may be indicative for darker beer colours resulting from a malt lot or even for the potential to induce primary gushing. Many German brewers use a method in which the number of red-discoloured kernels is counted in a malt lot. The ‘relevant’ grains show a discoloration typical for Fusarium contamination and malt lots with more than five such grains in
216 |  Niessen


200g will lead to rejection by the brewery (Nies-sen et al., 1991; Niessen et al., 1992; Engelmann et al., 2012). The method is rapid and requires little effort to be implemented. However, it requires some experience to differentiate ‘relevant’ grains from ‘non-relevant’ red discolorations. Kernels may be mistakenly stained in shades of red by growth of other moulds, e.g. Epicoccum nigrum, or red yeast belonging to genera Rhodotorula, Rhodosporidium, Sporidiobolus, Sporobolomyces, and Phafia.
In order to assess fungal contamination and fungal secondary metabolites in brewing cereals and malt, physical and chemical sensors are increas-ingly applied in modern quality control because results are more objective and reliable as compared to visual and olfactory analysis (Logrieco et al., 2005). Visual and acoustic sensors make use of dif-ferences between contaminated and sound grains in regard to absorption or reflection of light or acoustic waves. Both types of analysis provide non-destructive measurement of fungal biomass and secondary metabolites in cereal samples. Acoustic wave sensors have been applied to the detection of trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat using either transmission of acoustic waves at frequencies of 5–36kHz or reflection of an acoustic impulse in a frequency range 0 – 125kHz (Juodeikiene et al., 2004). Sensors have been developed for the detec-tion of DON (Juodeikiene et al., 2004, 2008) and DON in co-occurrence with T2-toxin/HT2-toxin (Juodeikiene et al., 2011) in wheat samples. Avail-able visual techniques use different parts of the light spectrum from UV/visible to near- and far-infrared. Levasseur-Garcia  (2012)  provides  an  overview of the application of infrared spectroscopy for the identification and detection of fungi and fungal metabolites on cereal grain. The method makes use of the fact that infrared (IR, 2500nm to 25µm) and near infrared (NIR, 760–2500nm) light induces molecular vibration in organic molecules, which can be measured very sensitively. The analysis of resulting spectra both of acoustic wave-based analy-sis or IR- and NIR-based analysis uses multivariate, chemometric  methods  in  which  statistical  cor-relations between the spectra and certain sample parameters such as mycotoxin concentrations or fungal biomass are established. In order to address such correlations specifically, the range of wave-lengths has to be determined for each parameter at which a maximum correlation between deviation

from a non-infected sample and the quantity of the assessed parameter, e.g. a mycotoxin or fungal biomass, can be observed. NIR spectroscopy has been applied to the assessment of DON concentra-tions concurrently with ergosterol and numbers of scabby grains as an indicator for fungal biomass in wheat (Dowell et al., 1999) and barley (Roberts et al., 1991; Börjessen et al., 2007). Also chitin is a compound typically produced by fungi and yeasts that has been applied to the detection of mould contamination in barley and other food sources (Roberts et al., 1991; Cousin, 1996). Since both parameters are prevalent in all fungal organisms, no  species-specific  detection  of  fungi  in  con-taminated materials is possible with this method. Fourier-transformed  infrared  microscopy  (FTIR microscopy) is a method using the same principles as described above but it is used to analyse pure cultures of microorganisms including moulds and yeasts and identify them at the species level by com-paring sample spectra with reference spectra from a database (Santos et al., 2010; Wenning and Scherer, 2013). In hyperspectral imaging the reflectance of a sample is analysed at various wavelength bands ranging from UV to NIR. For analysis, colour and light intensity of each pixel of the image is analysed for each wavelength band and differences between colour and light distribution in images of contami-nated and non-contaminated reference samples are compared. Systems have been commercialized for brewing applications such as detection of Fusarium contamination in wheat (Delwiche et al., 2011).
Chemical  detection  of  fungal  contamination and fungal secondary metabolites is a field that has been extensively studied for several decades and is widely used for the analysis of brewing raw materials and beer (Lattanzio et al., 2009). Analytical  protocols  for  all  known  mycotoxins have been extensively reviewed by several authors (Jarvis, 2003; Shephard, 2008; Rahmani et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2009). Protocols usually com-prise  sampling,  sample  preparation,  extraction, cleanup, separation, detection and quantification of  mycotoxins.  Extraction  from  contaminated samples is performed using organic solvents or solvent mixtures of optimized polarity in order to separate the analytical target compound from the matrix and other compounds interfering with the analysis. Further cleanup by liquid-liquid extrac-tion  or  solid  phase  extraction  (reversed  phase,

ion exchange, immunoafinity) can be applied to remove non-target compounds and to concentrate analytes. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high performance   liquid   chromatography   (HPLC), gas  chromatography  (GC)  and  electrophoresis have been used as technical platforms to separate extracted analytes. Absorption of UV and visible light, fluorescence with or without derivatization as well as mass spectrometry are applied to detect the previously separated analytes. Identification of analytes has been accomplished by comparison of retention times with reference materials. HPLC and GC separation have been combined with mass spectrometry (LC-MS, GC-MS) for identification of individual compound peaks. Currently, the most sophisticated analytical systems use tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in which the first MS (MS1) is used to separate different compounds present in an LC-peak after electrospray ioniza-tion (ESI) and the second MS (MS2) provides further analysis of selected mass fragments from MS1 for identification. Analysis of each sample in positive and negative ionization mode enables detection  and  quantification  of  >130  different secondary metabolites including frequently occur-ring mycotoxins and their glycosylated derivatives (Vishwanath et al., 2009; Streit et al., 2013). Using an LC-MS/MS-based method that could detect 15 different mycotoxins in parallel analysis, Tamura et al. (2011) analysed samples of beer and beer-based drinks from the Japanese market and found NIV, DON and fumonisins in low concentrations. Romero-Gonzalez et al. (2009) used an LC-MS/ MS-based system to detect 12 different mycotox-ins in beer. Analysis of a small set of commercial samples  revealed  occurrence  of  T2-  and  HT-2
toxins, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B2 in low con-
centrations in some samples. Zachariasova et al. (2010) developed a multimycotoxin method for the screening of 32 different compounds in beer but did not show results of sample analyses. Quan-tification of analytes in all the chemical detection methods described above is possible by calibration with  external  standards.  Calibration  with  inter-nal standards has been demonstrated for several mycotoxins with isotopically labelled derivatives in stable isotope dilution assays (SIDA) (Rychlik and Asam, 2008).
Afinity-based  detection  of  mycotoxins  has relied mainly on the use of antibodies or fragments

thereof.  However,  recently  DNA-based  aptam-ers and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) have been developed and applied for the specific analysis of mycotoxins (Maragos et al., 2009b).
Aflatoxin B1 (Ma et al., 2014), aflatoxin M1 (Mal-
hotra et al., 2014), DON (Eifler, 2014), Fumonisin
B1  (McKeague et al., 2010), OTA (Cruz-Aguado
and Penner., 2008), T2-toxin (Chen et al., 2014) and zearalenone (Chen et al., 2013) can now be detected on the basis of single-stranded DNA oli-gonucleotide aptamers of 50–100 nucleotides in length which form a three-dimensional structure specifically upon contact with the analyte molecule (Sampson, 2003). MIP form hollow three-dimen-sional structures in which the target molecule can be  trapped  specifically  by  mutual  electrostatic interaction of side groups (Haupt and Mosbach, 2000). They provide solid-phase materials with a molecular memory for the target compounds and have been utilized in solid-phase extraction of and sensors for the detection of fumonisin analogues (de Smet  et  al., 2009), DON and zearalenone (Weiss et al., 2003), OTA (Baggiani et al., 2001) and moniliformin (Appell et al., 2007).
Antibody-based   immunochemical   detection methods are based on the stereo-specific binding reaction between the variable domain of an immu-noglobulin (antibody) and its antigen. Extensive information about development and use of immu-noglobulins is available in specialized literature and in textbooks (Owen et al., 2013; Murphy, 2012; Delves et al., 2011; Subramanian, 2004; Campbell, 2000).
Various  immunochemical  assays  have  been described  for  the  detection  of  fungal  mycelia. However, the largest part of the literature covers detection of clinically relevant species. A smaller number of publications deals with the analysis of phytopathogenic fungi and other plant-associated species. The following literature review describes immunochemical assays that have been set up for the analysis of fungi that have been described to grow on cereals or cereal-based foods. The mono-clonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera described have not necessarily been described for analysis of barley and wheat or malt produced therefrom but the methods used can in principle be used for that purpose after proper modification of the sample preparation protocol. Notermans and Heuvelman (1985) were the first to develop specific antisera for
218 |  Niessen


the detection of foodborne moulds. Their antisera were raised by immunization of rabbits with freeze-dried  preparations  of  protein  precipitates  from cultures of Mucor racemosus, Fusarium oxysporum, and  Penicillium  verrucosum.  The  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay set up with the P. verrucosum specific antiserum was shown to detect most Penicillium species (Notermans et al., 1986). Kamphuis et al. (1989) developed an immunochemical latex agglutination assay for the rapid detection of a broad spectrum of foodborne Aspergillus and Penicillium species. Later, Dewey et al. (1990) used antibodies specific for Penicil-lium islandicum to set up an immunological test strip format for the analysis of rice samples. Tsai and Cousin (1990) published an ELISA for the simultaneous detection of different moulds such as  Aspergillus  versicolor,  Cladosporium  herbarum, Geotrichum candidum, Mucor circinelloides and Peni-cillium chrysogenum in yoghurt and cheese. An even wider range of grain-associated fungi, including Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp. as well as typi-cal field fungi such as Septoria spp. and Fusarium spp., can be detected with the assays described by Banks and colleagues (Banks et al., 1994, 1996). Penicillium aurantiogriseum was detected in cereals by Lu et al. (1994) in a highly specific manner using a monoclonal antiserum against the fungus. Chang and Yu (1997) developed a rapid immunochemical detection method for Aspergillus parasiticus and Penicillium citrinum and applied it to the analysis of rice and maize. Tsai and Yu (1999) used the same antiserum for the analysis of cereals. The detection of mycelia of aflatoxin-producing fungi in cereals and foodstuffs using an immunochemical method was described by several authors (Shapira et al., 1997; Yong and Cousin, 2001). Immunochemical methods have also been developed for the detec-tion  of  Fusarium  contaminations  in  cereals.  A polyclonal serum for the collective determination of F. avenaceum, F. culmorum and F. graminearum contamination was obtained after immunization with the supernatant of a still culture of F. culmorum by Beyer et al. (1993). An even broader spectrum of detected Fusarium species was reported by Iyer and Cousin (2003), who applied the assay to the analysis of grains and food. Rohde and Rabenstein (2005) reported similar results with polyclonal antisera produced in rabbits against mycelia of F. gramine-arum and F. culmorum, respectively, which they

applied for the analysis of wheat grains. Banks et al. (1996) described the use of a monoclonal antibody for the specific detection of F. avenaceum in cereals. The use of polyclonal antibodies raised in chicken eggs for the detection of F. poae was described by Gan et al. (1997). In an attempt to detect infec-tion of maize with fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp., Meirelles et al. (2006) set up an ELISA-based immunoassay using a polyclonal antiserum raised against an unknown peptide from a F. verticillioides culture. Finally, Meyer and Dewey (2000) used a culture supernatant to raise monoclonal antibodies for the detection of Botrytis cinerea in a wide variety of plants.
Even  more  importance  has  been  given  to the immunochemical analysis of mycotoxins as harmful fungal secondary metabolites in brewing cereals and malt. Zheng et al. (2006), Maragos (2006) and Maragos and Busman (2010) provide comprehensive reviews of the literature describing classical and modern methods of immunochemical mycotoxin analysis. Assays based on ELISA have been described for the detection of a great variety of different mycotoxins, including those described previously in section, ‘Mycotoxins’. Those assays are commercially available for application in brew-ing cereals, malt, and beer after appropriate sample preparation (Rahmani et al., 2009). This type of assay is based on a competitive reaction between free and solid-phase-bound mycotoxin for binding to an enzyme-labelled specific antibody. Usually reactions are performed in 96-well microtitre plates as  the  solid  phase.  Following  specific  binding, unbound analyte and antibodies are removed by washing and detection of the binding event is per-formed after addition of a chromogenic enzyme substrate  (Turner  et  al.,  2009).  The  developed colour  is  measured  spectrophotometrically  and light absorption is inversely proportional to analyte concentration. The major advantages of ELISA are speed, low-cost and user-friendliness, because it is portable and easy to perform even under on-site conditions in the brewery (Pleadin et al., 2012). Numerous variations of the ELISA format have been described, differing mainly in enzyme labels and substrates used and in the choice of the solid phase-bound reaction partner.
Other   variations   of   immunoassays   involve the   use   of   fluorochrome-labelled   mycotoxins or  antibodies  enabling  direct  signal  detection.
Fungal Contamination of Barley and Malt |  219


Fluorescence polarization immunoassays do not involve solid phase binding of components. They have been set up for many important mycotoxins. The method measures the change in fluorescence intensity in a solution upon binding of a fluores-cently labelled antigen to a specific antibody in relation to the concentration of free antigen in a sample, thus allowing its direct quantification with high sensitivity within minutes (Maragos, 2009a). All major mycotoxins potentially occurring in raw materials and beer can be detected with this method even though no application has been described so far for that specific purpose.
Another variation of the immunosorbent assay is a technology in which the specific antibody or the antigen is immobilized on the surface of a mem-brane and brought into contact with the free antigen in a sample solution. The method is marketed as a lateral flow device (LFD) assay and is available for the detection of all important mycotoxins, includ-ing those occurring in the barley-to-beer chain (Anfossi et al., 2013). Indirect and direct assay formats provide the carrier-bound mycotoxin or the   mycotoxin-specific   antibody,   respectively, immobilized on a nylon membrane. Upon sample application, the free mycotoxin binds to a specific antibody bound to gold nano particles (GNP) in the indirect format or is just mixed with a GNP-bound conjugate of the toxin in direct format. As the sample fluid moves along the LFD membrane by capillary force, hitherto unreacted antibodies are retained by binding to the immobilized antigen in the indirect assay or free and GNP-bound toxin molecules compete for binding to the immobilized antibody in direct assays. In both cases the immo-bilized GNP result in formation of a red-coloured line, the intensity of which is inversely proportional to the concentration of free mycotoxin in a sample. The same principle has recently been used for the parallel analysis of aflatoxins, DON, and zearale-none in a multiplex assay (Song et al., 2014).
Apart  from  the  aforementioned  mycotoxin assays, in which the afinity-based binding event is transduced visually, mostly as a colour change, several  other  principles  of  biosensoric  signal transduction have been applied to the study of mycotoxins (Pohanka et al., 2007). Electrochemical transducers measure electron movement (potentio-metric), current change (amperometric) or changes in conductivity (conductometric) occurring due

to the binding event or due to activity of a label enzyme. Optical biosensors use optical phenom-ena occurring due to binding of afinity molecules such as antibodies or aptamers to a glass surface or a gold-coated glass surface, the light reflective prop-erties of which are influenced by the binding event. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sensors have been used to detect and quantify the most important mycotoxins occurring in food (Li et al., 2012). Fibreoptic or optical waveguide biosensors make use of the induction of an evanescent light wave when light is totally reflected at the inner sur-face of a glass fibre. Provided the evanescent wave has got the right wavelength, it can be absorbed by fluorophore molecules in close proximity to the surface of the fibre and induce fluorescence, which can be measured by coupling back into the fibre (Maragos and Thompson, 1999). Biosenors based on the technology have been developed for afla-toxins and fumonisins (Thompson and Maragos, 1996; Maragos and Thompson, 1999).

Microbiological methods
Cultural methods for the detection and quantifi-cation of mould propagules in food and food raw materials have long been used (Jarvis et al., 1983; Beuchat, 1987; Gourama and Bullerman, 1995; Pitt and Hocking, 2009; Samson et al., 2010). They make use of the fact that viable moulds and yeasts can be detected and counted after cultivation of a sample on microbiological culture media, either as numbers of contaminated individual particles or as colony-forming units. In addition to mere detection and enumeration of fungal contamination, exact identification of the species is of prime importance because  species  identification  may  provide  an indication of possible quality problems associated with the investigated sample. This is particularly important when assessing a possible mycotoxin contamination.  Microbiological  testing  methods have the advantage that they can be easily handled in the laboratory without much equipment, other than a microscope. They can be applied to a variety of different materials to be tested.
The microbiological growth media applied in fungal analysis of food can be divided into general growth media for detection of a wide range of fungi and yeasts and selective media allowing growth of a restricted number of species. Besides the choice of the medium, selective growth of certain species
220 |  Niessen


or groups of species can be achieved by the choice of proper incubation conditions. As an example, an incubation temperature of 37°C is applied for the  selective  cultivation  of  human  pathogenic yeasts from food samples using a non-selective culture medium such as malt extract agar or YPG where the high incubation temperature leads to exclusion of mesophilic yeasts, most of which are non-pathogenic to humans. Also for the investiga-tion of the presence of heat-resistant moulds in pasteurized foods, the selection is done through a pre-treatment of the sample at 70°C before incuba-tion of cultures at elevated temperatures rather than by the use of a selective growth medium (Pitt and Hocking,  2009).  Today,  non-selective  detection and enumeration of a broad spectrum of moulds and yeasts from food sources and from the air is routinely done on Dichloran Rose Bengal Chlo-ramphenicol agar (DRBC agar, King et al., 1979). The medium is selective for ascomyceteous and basidiomycetous filamentous and yeast fungi but growth of bacteria and Zygomycetes is largely sup-pressed by additives. For the selective investigation of xerophilic fungi as an important group of food-borne and airborne fungi, Dichloran 18% Glycerol agar is often used (DG18 agar, Hocking and Pitt, 1980). DRBC and DG18 have been certified by the  International  Organization  for  Standardiza-tion (ISO) for enumeration of yeasts and moulds in high water activity food and animal feedstuffs
(aw >0.95, ISO 21527-1) and low water activity
foods and animal feedstuffs (aw <0.95, ISO 21527–
2), respectively. However, both culture media are better suited for general growth and enumeration than for identification of fungi because they do not properly develop the micro- and macro-morpho-logical features that are needed for identification. As a consequence, subcultures have to be prepared on optimal media in order to identify an isolate to the species level. In regard to morphological identification of species, it is particularly important that the morphological features of the moulds are properly expressed. Therefore, different media are used for enumeration, isolation, or identification. Complex media such as malt extract agar, oatmeal agar, maize meal agar, potato dextrose agar are often used for cultivation but also synthetic media, such as SNA have been used and are superior for some groups of fungi. Some species or genera may also

need specific media such as clove leaf agar, Czapek yeast autolysate agar or cherry decoction to form the characteristic structures that are important for their identification. Many species have to be incu-bated at different growth conditions or incubated under UV light or in darkness in order to bring about the typical morphological structures needed for their identification.
In  studies  focusing  on  detection  and  enu-meration  of  single  fungal  species  or  groups  of physiologically  similar  species,  selective  media may provide a tool to circumvent extensive isola-tion  for  species  identification.  Selective  growth conditions are created both by specifying certain
growth parameters such as aw, pH, salinity or sugar
content. Moreover, the selection of certain fungi on the growth medium can also be affected by addition of substances that kill unwanted organ-isms, or at least strongly inhibit their development. An example for this is addition of substances such as iprodione (Abildgren et al., 1987), dichloran (Andrews  and  Pitt,  1986;  Conner,  1992),  rose Bengal (Newhouse and Hunter, 1983) or penta-chloro-nitorbenzole  (PCNB,  Nash  and  Snyder, 1962; Nishikawa and Kohgo, 1975; Gyllang et al., 1981; Burgess et al., 1988) to general growth media such as Szapek Dox agar in order to create selective conditions for the examination of Fusarium infesta-tion in cereals. Fusarium spp. are highly resistant to both compounds and can therefore be selectively enumerated in a genus-specific manner. However, isolations still have to be made for species identifi-cation. Based on PCNB agar, further development led to species-selective media that can be applied to investigate either F. graminearum (mannitol-PCNB agar, Böhm-Schraml et al., 1993) or F. culmorum (malachite green agar, Böhm-Schraml, 1995) in brewing cereals and malt. The use of dichloran rose bengal yeast extract sucrose agar (DRYS, Frisvad, 1983) or dichloran yeast-extract sucrose 18% glyc-erol agar (DYSG, Elmholt et al., 1999) proved to be a valuable tool in the microbiological analysis of food commodities for mycotoxin-producing Peni-cillium spp. The latter medium is even useful in the selective differentiation of Penicillium verrucosum from P. nordicum, both producers of ochratoxin A. AFPA agar is useful for the selective identification of aflatoxin-producing species such as Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. Aflatoxinogenic species

can be recognized by their typical orange-red colour when colonies are observed from their reverse (Pitt et al., 1983).

Molecular biological methods
A disadvantage of using microbiological methods routinely for detection, enumeration and identifi-cation of foodborne moulds and yeasts is the long period of 5–14 days necessary for the investiga-tion. Moreover, as extensive knowledge of fungal morphology and systematics is necessary for a qualitative assessment, a high degree of specializa-tion is needed for the analysis. Also, the fact that microbiological  analysis  can  only  detect  living fungal mycelia and yeasts may appear as a problem. Sample materials in which fungal propagules are not viable or not able to be cultivated on the media used cannot be studied. However, many of the materials tested in food mycology have undergone longer periods of storage or have been processed before analysis and will therefore contain no or only few living propagules. Especially for processed materials, the knowledge of the microbiological history of a sample is of great importance for the assessment of potential consumer risks associated with a sample. Methods based on the detection and analysis of DNA or RNA circumvent many of the mentioned problems because they have the advantage of being much faster and highly specific. Moreover they and can be applied for the detection of both living and dead organisms.

PCR-based methods
The right column in Table 8.1 gives a list of publica-tions describing PCR-based detection for fungal species frequently encountered on raw and malted seeds of barley and wheat. The list of publications does not reflect the complete literature available but has been restricted to cite the original descrip-tions of a primer pair or, in cases where several different primer pairs have been described for the same gene in a species, the first publication for each of the different genes is shown. The list of publications clearly shows that almost all species are covered by the availability of at least one pair of species-specific primers. Fusarium anthophilum, F. camptoceras, F. sacchari, Gonatobotrys simplex, Harzia  acremonioides,  Nigrospora  sphaerica  and Ramichloridium  schulzeri  are  the  only  species among the 41 species and species groups listed in

Table 8.1 for which no records of a species-specific PCR-based  detection  assay  were  found  in  the literature. The reason for this failure of a specific PCR-based detection system may be either their highly infrequent occurrence, the fact that they have very low importance as pathogens or food spoilage organisms, or the unavailability of a suita-ble sequence source. It is interesting to observe that many of the species can be specifically detected by primers covered by a patent (Haugland and Vesper, 2000) that was granted to the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) in 2002. The patent documentation contains all the primer and probe sequences needed to set up TaqMan -based detec-tion assays for more than 130 fungal species and some important groups of fungal species. Although licenses for the commercialization of primers have been granted to companies in the USA, Germany and  United  Kingdom  the  sequences  are  avail-able on the US-EPO homepage under www.epa. gov/microbes/moldtech.htm#primers   for   non-commercial use. All primers and probes listed by that source have been set up to bind to sequences of  genes  coding  for  genomic  or  mitochondrial ribosomal RNA in the target organisms, including the ribosomal RNA genes, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS), the intergenic spacers (IGS) and the non-transcribed spacers (NTS) present in such genes. Similarly, various of the listed references have used that sequence source for primer design. However, other sequence sources, such as universal genes coding for proteins with cellular housekeep-ing functions (calmodulin, β-tubulin, elongation factor 1α, chitin synthase, topoisomerase), func-tions in fungal reproduction (mating type genes MAT1, MAT2, MAT3) or universal mitochondrial genes (cytb, cox1,  cox2) have been applied for primer design. Several authors used genes coding for enzymes or regulatory proteins involved in the production of secondary metabolites or other enzymes and structural proteins, which turn out to be characteristic for the target fungus to develop species-specific   PCR   primers,   e.g.   mycotoxin biosynthetic  pathway  genes,  alkaline  protease, chitinase, actin or histone 3. Niessen et al. (2008) reviewed the PCR-based methods available for the diagnosis of mycotoxin-producing fungi as the most important group in terms of hygiene in brewing cereals and malt. Authors showed that PCR-based diagnostic assays have been developed for the vast

majority of mycotoxigenic fungi potentially occur-ring on brewing cereals and malt.

LAMP-based methods
Apart  from  enzyme-free  self-templated  ampli-fication  systems  currently  under  development (Dong et al., 2012; Michaelis et al., 2014; Jung and Ellington, 2014), a variety of different methods for isothermal enzymatic in vitro DNA amplification have been developed over the past 20 years (see reviews by Gill and Ghaemi, 2008; Fakruddin et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2014; Li and Macdonald, 2015). Most isothermal amplification systems have the advantage of being easily operated with simple equipment since no thermal cycling is necessary as in PCR. Moreover, they are useful tools in point-of-care (POC) applications in clinical settings making them highly attractive for the diagnostic industry. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an approach to nucleic acid amplification that is especially suitable due to its high specificity, rapidness, user friendliness and low price. Niessen (2015) reviewed its application for the diagnosis of filamentous fungi and yeasts. The method has been applied for the species-specific diagnosis of Fusarium graminearum (Niessen and Vogel, 2010) and F. tricinctum (Niessen et al., 2012) in wheat and barley as well as for the group-specific detec-tion of gushing-inducing Fusarium spp. (Denschlag et al., 2012, 2013) and producers of trichothecene mycotoxins (Denschlag et al., 2014) in cereals and malt. Moreover, is has been applied to the detection and identification of Saccharomyces brewing yeasts and wild yeasts in beer and other sources (Hayashi et al., 2007, 2009).
The  method  relies  on  auto-cycling  strand displacement DNA synthesis performed by ther-mophilic  DNA  polymerases  under  isothermal conditions with a set of four specifically designed primers. These hybridize to six different parts of the target DNA sequence (Notomi et al., 2000). A com-prehensive explanation of the reaction mechanisms involved can be found in the literature (Notomi et al., 2000; Tomita et al., 2008; Niessen, 2015). Fig. 8.2 shows a schematic representation of the differ-ent reaction steps leading to DNA synthesis during LAMP. The method basically makes use of the large fragment of the Bst DNA polymerase from Geoba-cillus stearothermophilus. The large fragment of the enzyme contains the 5′→3′ polymerase activity but

lacks 5′→3′ exonuclease activity. Similar enzymes (Bsm, GspM, GsM 2.0, GspSSP) from other bac-terial hosts as well as optimized versions of the original Bst polymerase (Bst 2.0, Bst warmstart) are now commercially available (Chander et al., 2014; Woźniakowski and Samorek-Salamonowicz, 2014; Kang et al., 2014). The Bst DNA polymerase large fragment displaces third-strand DNA with high eficiency during primer-initiated polymerization of new DNA, leaving a double-stranded product and a single-stranded DNA strand, which can act as the matrix for further primer annealing and DNA polymerization.
Since Bst DNA polymerase has a very high activ-ity, vast amounts of high-molecular-weight DNA are produced within a short time. The exception-ally high specificity of LAMP is because a set of four primers with six binding sites must hybridize correctly  to  their  target  sequence  before  DNA biosynthesis occurs. A third pair of primers (loop primers) can be added optionally to the reaction in order to further amplify the amount of DNA produced during LAMP (Nagamine et al., 2002). One of the primer pairs is constructed in such a way that the reverse complement of a binding site downstream of the F2c/B2c binding site (F1c/ B1c) is attached to the 5′-end of a primer binding to that site. These composite primers are essential for the specificity of the amplification reaction and thus have to be chosen very carefully. Both parts of each FIP/BIP primer should be checked for cross-reactivity by in silico analysis (e.g. BLAST) prior to application in LAMP reactions. A pair of outer primers (F3/B3) anneals upstream of the F2c/B2c binding site to displace the initial LAMP product strand from the DNA matrix. Specificity of outer primers can be regarded as being of lower importance since they are not involved in any of the following amplification reactions and a low number of base mismatches will not prevent ampli-fication. The process is initiated by attachment of primers to the DNA target. Primers are elongated and the second matrix strand is displaced from the target DNA. The newly synthesized product itself is displaced from the matrix strand by the F3/B3 product strand. Primers F3 and B3 have no further function once the amplification process has been initiated. As the final product of the amplification initiation   step,   a   dumbbell-structured,   single-stranded DNA is formed by hybridization of both

ends of the molecule to complementary down-stream sequences, forming two loops. Starting from this structure, primers FIP and BIP continuously hybridize to newly generated binding sites and are elongated, displaced and refolded while form-ing ever-longer multimers of the basic dumbbell structure. Loop primers are designed to hybridize to the single-stranded loop structures present in the dumbbell structures as well as in the multimeric DNA formed during autocycling DNA amplifica-tion. They prime the production of novel template DNA to which FIP/BIP primers can bind to initiate synthesis of even higher concentrations of DNA. Addition  of  loop  primers  therefore  does  not increase the sensitivity of amplification but rather enables earlier detection of a LAMP signal as com-pared with a reaction run without loop primers.
Direct detection of amplification in LAMP can be done by addition of DNA intercalating dyes (SYTO 9, SYBR Green 1, ethidium bromide) or fluorescent hybridization probes. Indirect detec-tion   is   accomplished   via   Mg-pyrophosphate turbidity or calcein fluorescence (see reviews by Niessen et al., 2013; Niessen, 2015). Quantification of template DNA concentrations is possible but not very accurate due to the autocycling nature of the amplification reaction (Denschlag et al., 2013; Niessen, 2015). Beside its speed and ease of use, robustness is another major advantage of LAMP assays over PCR. It has been demonstrated that the reaction is quite insensitive against inhibitors from the sample matrix (Kaneko et al., 2007; Francois et al., 2011). Simple procedures for sample prepara-tion are therefore suficient in many cases to obtain a signal after addition of mycelia or fungal spores just washed off cereal or malt grains directly to the LAMP reaction mix (Luo et al., 2012, 2014; Denschlag et al., 2014). Application of the LAMP method for the analysis of brewing cereals and malt was demonstrated by Denschlag et al. (2012, 2013) who designed primers that detected the hyd5 gene coding for the class 2 hydrophobin Hyd5p in Fusar-ium spp., which have been associated with gushing in beer. The assay detected F. cerealis, F. culmorum, and F. graminearum and had a detection limit of three Fusarium-contaminated grains in 200g. Anal-ysis of gushing-positive and gushing-negative malts revealed good correlation with gushing-test results (modified Carlsberg′s test) and showed that the latter test seems to overestimate gushing potential.

The same authors developed another LAMP-based assay detecting tox5 and tox6, two genes involved in  the  production  of  trichothecene  mycotoxins in Fusarium spp. (Denschlag et al., 2014). The assay was applied to the analysis of wheat. LAMP results corresponded well with the presence of DON in respective samples at threshold values of 163 ppb and 1000 ppb when DNA extraction or a simple lavage of the samples was used for sample preparation,  respectively.  Niessen  et  al.  (2012) demonstrated  the  usefulness  of  LAMP  for  the detection of F. tricinctum in barley samples and in single barley grains by immersing single seeds into the LAMP master mix prior to the reaction.


Control of fungal contamination in brewing cereals
The previous sections have discussed problems aris-ing from fungal contamination of brewing cereals and malt, and the opportunities for detection and identification of fungi and their metabolic products. However, for maltsters and brewers the prevention of contamination or at least the prevention of fungal growth and release of secondary metabolites would be a preferred goal. Basically, two different strategies can be applied to reach the goal of minimizing the adverse effects of filamentous fungi and yeasts on the quality of malt and beer: prevention of fungal contamination of raw materials and prevention of fungal growth during storage and malt production.

Prevention of fungal contamination of raw materials
As described earlier in this chapter, the interac-tion between fungal contaminants and the cereal plant is highly complex, influenced by a variety of physiological and environmental factors. Plant responses to different stresses are highly complex and involve changes at the transcriptome, cellular, and physiological levels both in plant and fungus (Atkinson and Urwin, 2012). Infection of plant tissues by a fungus is only possible if the plant has no mechanisms to defend itself against the attack, i.e.  a  compatible  interaction.  In  incompatible interactions the plant has an appropriate mecha-nism in place that prevents it from being attacked by the fungus. Such mechanisms can be directed to a particular pathogen in a highly specific way, e.g. sacrificing infected tissue areas in which cells

die shortly after the attack, depriving the fungus of nutrients and water (hypersensitive reaction, suicide mechanism) or more generalized to fungal attackers by forming mechanical barriers such as the cuticle (Martin, 1964), production of low-molecu-lar-weight antifungal compounds (phytoanticipins, phytoalexins) (Morrissey and Osbourne, 1999), antifungal proteins and peptides (De Lucca et al., 2005), protease inhibitors (Ryan, 1990), produc-tion  of  chitinases,  β-1,3-glucanases  and  other hydrolytic enzymes (Li et al., 2001), just to name a few (see review by Heitefuss, 2001). Establishing or improving specific or unspecific defence mecha-nisms against fungal attack and spreading of fungal mycelia in plants is the aim of cereal plant breeding. Since the devastating head blight epidemics of the 1990s and ensuing years, resistance to Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum as well as reduction of DON accumulation has become a major goal in barley and wheat breeding (Mesterhazy, 2014; McMullen et al., 2012) since infections have a high economical as well as human and animal health impact (Windels, 2000).
In addition to plant breeding, agrochemicals have long been used to combat fungal growth in the field. Compounds are applied either as a seed treatment to protect the growing plant from attack by soil borne fungi or by spraying plants during the vegetation period. No chemical treatment is availa-ble to date providing general protection from fungal attack or general reduction of fungal growth and spreading. However, specific treatments for par-ticular pathogens are available and widely used to prevent yield loss. Some fungi of specific relevance to the brewing industry such as Fusarium gramine-arum are dificult to control in the field. However, recent research has allowed some improvements. Salgado et al. (2014) demonstrated that integration of growing moderately resistant varieties, applica-tion of a mixed treatment with tebuconazole and prothioconazole (also metconazole, Tateishi et al., 2014) as well as the use of appropriate harvesting equipment and settings resulted in a significant reduction  of  DON  concentrations  at  increased grain yields and thus in reduction of discounts from wheat prices. Similar effects can be anticipated for the barley-to-malthouse chain. Crop rotation is an additional technical measure that can be taken in order to reduce the presence of pathogens and quality-reducing fungi in cereal crops (Marburger

et al., 2015). It is well established now that plant-ing maize prior to wheat or barley, or wheat prior to barley, will accumulate Fusarium graminearum inoculum in the soil for infection of the cereals during  germination,  resulting  in  an  increase  of DON  concentrations  and  gushing  potential  of malts (Bilikova and Hudec, 2014). Microorganisms have been investigated as control agents for cereal diseases caused by Fusarium species in the field, including FHB (Khan and Doohan, 2009) and seedling blight (Khan et al., 2006). The application of antagonistic microbial cultures in the field has proven to be eficient in reducing Fusarium spp. and other fungal contaminations (Weller, 1988; Kiss, 2003; Junaid et al., 2013).

Prevention of fungal growth during storage and malt production
The environmental conditions prevailing during long-term storage of brewing cereals are essential for growth of fungi and for their metabolic activ-ity. Availability of water and oxygen are the most important	growth-limiting	factors	alongside temperature,  pH,  and  availability  of  nutrients (Christensen and Kaufmann, 1965; Lacey, 1989; Doohan et al., 2003; Magan and Aldred, 2007). Also, the production of mycotoxins during storage of cereals is influenced and limited by environmen-tal factors (Magan et al., 1984, 2010; Miller, 1995; Schrödter et al., 2004). Reduction of mycotoxin levels during storage of barley and other cereals has been achieved by controlling environmental condi-tions, including water activity (Magan and Aldred, 2007), and by addition of natural substances such as essential oils (Paster et al., 1995; Juglal et al., 2002; Chulze, 2010) or microbial starter cultures. Yeast strains (Björnberg and Schnürer, 1993; Petersson and Schnürer, 1995; Ädel-Druvefors and Schnürer, 2005), bacteria (Frändberg and Schnürer, 1995) or even fungi (Jensen et al., 2000) have been added to stored grain and were demonstrated to have a reducing or at least preserving effect on the fungal community.
Malting is a process in which a complex eco-system evolves due to the prevailing moisture and temperature  conditions,  thus  allowing  contami-nating microorganisms to develop and to have a negative influence on the quality of malt (Lai-tila, 2007; Laitila et al., 2007; Noots et al., 1999; Wolf-Hall, 2007; Raulio et al., 2009). The fungal
226 |  Niessen


community  and  other  microorganisms  growing during malting compete with grain metabolism for oxygen and may therefore considerably reduce grain  germination  during  malting  (Doran  and Briggs, 1993; Noots et al., 1999). The steeping step as part of the malting process strongly promotes growth of bacteria, yeasts, and fungi with the estab-lishment of stable biofilms on the grain surface (Laitila et al., 2007; Raulio et al., 2009). Beside fungal  growth,  significant  increases  in  levels  of several mycotoxins can occur during malting (Vegi et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 2012). As shown in Fig. 8.1, several Fusarium species were demonstrated to proliferate from steeping through germination until early stages of kilning (Oliveira et al., 2012; Sarlin et al., 2005b; Vegi et al., 2011). Fusarium mould depletes grain nutrients, such as starch and pro-tein, and colonizes its interior via exo-proteolytic and cellulolytic enzymes (Kang and Buchenauer, 2000; Oliveira et al., 2012, 2013), which can result in  malting  losses.  Prevention  of  fungal  growth during malting can be accomplished with chemi-cal,  physical,  and  biological  methods.  Addition of antifungal chemicals or general microbiocides is possible and has some inhibitive effect on the malt fungi. Presence of residues from the treat-ment will compromise the quality and safety of the malt produced and are therefore not recommend (Wolf-Hall, 2007). However, methods using gase-ous ozone or hydrogen peroxide may be promising since they do not leave any residues in the malt and have been shown to have some effect in reducing fungal growth during malt production (Kottapalli et al., 2005). Also, non-degrading physical methods such as electron-beam irradiation (Kottapalli et al., 2006) or microwave treatment (Akaranuchat et al., 2008) have been demonstrated to show some reductive effect on fungi during malt production. Growth  reduction  by  addition  of  appropriate starter cultures has been achieved in analogy to grain storage by addition of starter cultures during malt production (Boivin et al., 1997; Linko et al., 1998; Laitila et al., 2002; Wolf-Hall, 2007). Addi-tion of starters was either done during steeping or by spraying during soaking or germination. Special regulations may exist in national law of individual states or the EU. According to German national law any additives to the malting process are prohibited unless the malt is intended for export.

Conclusions
At the first glance fungal contamination of cereal crops is a rather two-faced problem, depending on the viewpoint of either the agricultural or brewing industry. Farmers are primarily interested in high yield quantity whereas malt producers and brewers are interested in high quality of their raw materi-als. A second glance, however, may reveal that also maltsters and brewers should be interested in high quantity since low barley prices always depend on high yield. Most fungal species prevailing on cereal grain do not seem to directly influence quantity and quality of either grain or malt, and much research has been given to just the few species involved in quantitative  or  qualitative  traits.  However,  not much is known about the mutual influence that fungal species and other microbes have in terms of grain and malt quality. It has been shown in previ-ous work that partners in microbial communities interact with each other in a positive or negative way (Laitila et al., 2007). Most interesting from the maltster’s or brewer’s perspective are interactions in which quality traits are positively influenced by competition, modification or antagonism between microbes (O’Mahoni et al., 2000). However, the details about these interactions still have to be elu-cidated in order to utilize the mechanisms involved to the advantage of grain and malt quality. Prelimi-nary results utilizing antagonistic bacteria, yeasts and fungi to reduce the growth of mainly Fusarium species during malt production showed promising results and have led to the development of modified malting processes (Rouse and van Sinderen, 2008; Laitila et al., 2006). Aside from growth reduction, deterioration of mycotoxins produced in the field during the malting or even the brewing process by otherwise harmless microbes will be a challenge for future research (Karlovsky, 1999).
Meanwhile, the malting and brewing industry is forced to take precautions in order to deal with the threat of quality problems posed by fungal contami-nation of their raw materials, in order to produce safe high-quality products. Measures must be taken to prevent mould- and mycotoxin-contaminated product from being processed and marketed. A variety of tools and protocols are now available that can be used to detect mycotoxins at every step along the line of the production processes in malt-ing and brewing. There is a choice between highly


sophisticated  and  specialized  methods  of  high specificity and sensitivity or more or less simple and rapid assays, many of which can be applied on-site during processing. Also, methods for the detec-tion of fungal contamination have evolved greatly during  recent  years  from  very  time-consuming microbiological techniques to very rapid immu-nochemical or molecular biological assay systems. Even the presence of certain genes in a sample can be detected and used to predict the probability of mycotoxin contaminations or quality failures such as gushing. Although the spectrum of analytical methods is wide and much of it has been applied in research and in model industrial processes, it will still take time to transfer them into procedures that will be accepted as standards by the brewing and malting industry.

Abstract
Consistent  production  of  quality  beer  requires brewers be concerned with not only the health of fermenting yeast and optimizing brewing condi-tions,  but  also  with  the  potential  for  bacterial contamination at every stage of production. This perpetual threat has driven investigation into mech-anisms of bacterial beer spoilage, with significant emphasis placed on isolates belonging to the group broadly known as lactic acid bacteria (LAB). These organisms are problematic for the global brewing industry, as they are not only able to grow in and spoil the harsh, niche environment of beer, but also frequently elude even current means of detection and control due to the lack of genetic uniformity among diverse brewing-related LAB. This chapter summarizes relevant background in beer spoilage LAB characterization, detection, and control within the context of beer spoilage LAB genetic variabil-ity. While traditional methods of analysis remain more accessible to brewers for quality control, the advantages of incorporating powerful omics-based methods within the industry are presented. Lastly, current omics methods are discussed in terms of their notable ability to help solve developing issues related to the use of LAB as controlled flavouring and/or fermentation agents by popular craft or specialty brewing operations.

Introduction to lactic acid bacteria in beer: ‘The good, the bad and the ugly’
One only has to perform a cursory literature search of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to be overwhelmed by available information extolling their industrial importance for fields ranging from human health to food production. Ultimately, LAB are a collection of  Gram-positive,  catalase-negative,  non-sporu-lating,  non-motile  and  acid-tolerant  organisms that share the capacity to produce lactic acid as a primary product of sugar fermentation while being incredibly heterogeneous in terms of physiological attributes,  metabolic  and  fermentation  capabili-ties, and ability to inhabit diverse niches (Pfeiler and Klaenhammer, 2007). These diverse attributes greatly increase both their presence and utility in the production of multiple food and beverage products, from wine and beer to cheese, dairy, meat and vegetable products (Makarova et al., 2006). Further, members of the LAB group that natu-rally occupy food and beverage niches have been ascribed the generally regarded as safe (GRAS) designation,  allowing  them  to  be  exploited  for improvement and preservation of a wide range of food and beverage products, and for the production of probiotics (Klaenhammer et al., 2005). Unfor-tunately, the unwanted presence or uncontrolled

over-growth of these organisms during food or beverage production can occur, posing challenges, as well as opportunities, especially to the brewing industry.
Beer is an unexpected environment to support microbial growth given that beer-spoiling bacteria must simultaneously overcome several physiologi-cal hurdles, including the antimicrobial action of ethanol and hop-derived bitter acids, low pH, lim-
ited available nutrients, and low O2, with concurrent high CO2  levels (Fernandez and Simpson, 1993;
Sakamoto and Konings, 2003; Simpson, 1993b). Nonetheless,  LAB  probably  have  always  been associated with and/or involved in the production of beer, either as a naturally occurring agent for traditional spontaneous-fermentation styles such as lambic or Weisse beers, producing characteristic ‘sour’ flavours via production of lactic or acetic acid (Tonsmeire, 2014) (see Chapter 7), or as an unseen source of spoilage that results in an undesired or poor quality product. Though the participation of LAB in beer-production and spoilage was not appreciated until Louis Pasteur began to isolate these bacterial cells from beer (Suzuki, 2011), their diverse historical role(s) in brewing allows for the general characterization of ‘the good, the bad, and the ugly’ outcomes of LAB involvement.
LAB isolates can indeed be helpful, if not nec-essary components, of specialized fermentations that produce specific beer styles, both traditional and new (Tonsmeire, 2014). This is increasingly important to consider in discussions of beer spoil-age-related (BSR) LAB, as the current global beer market is experiencing a significant expansion in the numbers of ‘local’ craft beers. The influx of new companies necessitates that breweries distinguish themselves with consumers through unique prod-ucts and this need has led to innovative use of raw materials and production processes, with the inclu-sion of both fermenting LAB and non-traditional yeasts. These ‘helpful’ fermenting LAB, however, must have several important attributes, chief among them being the inability to overgrow in beer and to not inhibit normal yeast function. Thus, current industry trends highlight an important context in which to consider brewing-associated LAB, and open up interesting avenues for how best to investi-gate and further the role of LAB in the spectrum of modern beer production.
Putting aside the expansion in modern brew

styles, the fact remains that since the industrial rev-olution, global brewing practices increasingly have focused on producing ‘clean’ and consistent brew products, free of bacteria and their metabolites (Tonsmeire, 2014). With the advent of pasteuriza-tion and appreciation for hygienic practices during food and beverage production, the average global beer consumer today is probably accustomed to ‘conventional’ or non-sour products, beers that are free from characteristic signs of LAB overgrowth. This means the beer should have no cloudy ‘haze’, no ‘sour’ taste or other unappealing off-flavours such as ‘buttery’ diacetyl, and be free of bacterial sedimentation or exopolysaccharide ‘slime’ (Back, 2005). Such occurrences in most beer products are unexpected, and encapsulate both the bad and the ugly results of unwanted LAB being present. The outcome of these spoilage events causes a loss of consumer and brand confidence when compro-mised beer is consumed, or significant revenue and time loss to the brewery in the event of batch contamination. As LAB are attributed with causing 60 – 90% of the brewing spoilage events worldwide (Asano et al., 2009; Back, 1994), significant inter-est has gone into ascertaining how they spoil beer and how this is best controlled. Despite this inter-est, incidence of BSR LAB contamination remains dificult to delineate due to under-appreciation of how diverse a group they are, even though relevant research constantly highlights this diversity.

The promise of omics for BSR LAB research
Recent review articles cover the evolution and cur-rent state of understanding of BSR LAB prevalence, genetics (Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013; Sakamoto and Konings, 2003; Suzuki, 2011b) and research techniques used during investigation (Ben-Amor et al., 2007; Bokulich and Mills, 2012b; Bokulich et al., 2012a,b). Though such background knowledge is of critical importance to understanding the cur-rent issues facing the brewing field, this chapter is not meant to be exhaustive of all relevant literature history to BSR LAB. Rather, this information is used to highlight the apparent gaps in knowledge and need for the expansion of research methods into omics applications.

and/or provide information on a microbial com-munity’s genetics, activities and ecology means that these omic approaches can effectively balance the interests of academia and industry, and overcome the problem of understanding BSR LAB variability. To date, research into BSR LAB has often failed to provide data of equal value to research investigators and brewers tasked with carrying out detection of contaminating BSR LAB. For example, detailed study of genetic or physiological stress response mechanisms of BSR LAB is of great value to LAB and brewing research writ large; however, these data alone present little utility to individual brew-ers. Further, the targeted analysis of just a few genes, or one physiological stressor in few specific isolates, has provided only minimal and incremental expan-sion  to  our  current  knowledge  regarding  LAB. Most importantly, findings from targeted-analysis experiments are frequently inconsistent for all BSR LAB, thus curtailing the value of these data from both academic and industry perspectives.
Omics approaches have proven to be a power-ful way to investigate LAB genetic and metabolic diversity (Claesson et al., 2007; Horvath et al., 2009; Marakova and Koonin, 2007), and when applied broadly, produce large amounts of data that can be mined to give statistically relevant genetic or metabolic markers for beer spoilage that could be effectively screened within breweries. Secondly, these approaches help distinguish potentially help-ful LAB from BSR LAB for use in specialty brews, by  correlating  limited  beer-growth  ability  with desirable genetic or metabolic traits, without having to develop optimal strains through the use of labo-rious genetic modification techniques. The meta data that is produced from omics approaches thus allows for the conversion of information obtained by broad-scale or community-analysis of BSR LAB to specific application required for application in the brewery.


Diversity, relatedness and maintenance of BSR LAB

General LAB characteristics
Problematic BSR LAB and sour-beer fermenting LAB alike traditionally belong to the Firmicutes phylum, order Lactobacillales, in the genera Lac-tobacillus  and  Pediococcus  (Priest,  2003),  with

Lactobacillus   brevis,   Lactobacillus   linderni   and Pediococcus damnosus being the most commonly encountered   bacteria   that   spoil   beer   (Back, 2005;  Menz  et  al.,  2010;  Priest,  2003;  Suzuki, 2008;  Thelen  et  al.,  2006).  Additional  LAB species  also  have  been  detected  with  varying frequencies in brewing environments, including Lactobacillus amylolyticus (Bohak et al., 1998), Lac-tobacillus backii (Bohak et al., 2006), Lactobacillus brevisimilis  (Back,  1987),  Lactobacillus  buchneri, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus coryneformis, Lac-tobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii (Priest, 2003), Lactobacillus dextrinicus (Haakensen et al., 2009a), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus fruc-tivorans, Lactobacillus malefermentans (Russell and Walker, 1953), Lactobacillus parabuchneri, (Priest, 2003), Lactobacillus paracollinoides (Suzuki, 2004), Lactobacillus plantarum (Priest, 2003; Thelen et al., 2006), Lactobacillus paraplantarum (Curk et al., 1996), Lactobacillus paucivorans (Ehrmann et al., 2010), Lactobacillus rossiae (Corsetti et al., 2005), Pediococcus claussenii (Dobson et al., 2002), Pedio-coccus inopinatus, Pediococcus parvulus (Martens et al., 1997) and Pediococcus pentosaceous (Jespersen and Jakobsen, 1996).
Despite the reported incidence of certain spe-cies within breweries, it must be emphasized that the ability for BSR LAB to grow in and spoil beer is not a species attribute, but is an isolate-specific capability, as is the case for most spoilage lactoba-cilli (Sanders et al., 2015). As this phenomenon indicates that there must be a level of genetic spe-cialization in a BSR LAB isolate that allows for the beer spoilage phenotype, the search for a small number of ‘detectable’ genetic markers has long been the focus of analysis. However, this narrow scope of investigation fails to appreciate the degree of genetic dissimilarity inherent among BSR LAB given that these isolates belong to the LAB group as a result of shared functional characteristics (i.e. particular metabolic capacities) and not necessarily genetic relatedness among LAB (Sun et al., 2014). Additionally, the use of ‘common’ BSR LAB isolates for the study of genetic differences probably pro-duces results that are non-universal for BSR LAB. Common isolates are those that can grow in routine culture media, and are thus probably consistently over-represented   during   detection   procedures (Suzuki et al., 2008). Given that not all Lactobacil-lus and Pediococcus isolates can grow in these media,

those that can likely skew incidence reports of beer spoilage, and therefore the amount of research interest and available information on BSR LAB.

BSR LAB diversity
To better understand the genetic adaptations that separate BSR LAB from non-spoiling isolates of the same species, and their origins, we must first examine the diversity of species involved. Both Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera are comprised of  Gram-positive,  catalase-negative  isolates  and share overlapping DNA G+C content (Lactobacil-lus: 32–55% mol and Pediococcus: 35–44 mol%). Although these two genera are closely related to each other and to the genus Leuconostoc, as dem-onstrated by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, they have several distinctive features (Schleifer and Ludwig, 1995). Pediococcus isolates grow under a range of facultatively aerobic to microaerophilic conditions and are homofermentative in that they
do not generate CO2  when they produce lactic
acid from fermentation of glucose (Holzapfel et al., 2009). Further, pediococci are not capable of reducing nitrate, while some lactobacilli isolates can (Hammes and Hertel, 2006; Hammes and Vogel, 1995). Lactobacillus species are generally anaerobic, although some are aerotolerant and may be either homofermentative like Pediococcus, or het-
erofermentative and produce lactic acid, CO2, and
ethanol and/or acetic acid as primary end products of fermentation.
Lactobacillus spp. are currently organized into three distinct metabolic or fermentative groups, prior to further phylogenetic arrangement based on genetic relatedness (Holzapfel and Wood, 2014; Sun et al., 2014). The first fermentation group is that  of  the  obligate  homofermentative  (OHO) species, which can only ferment hexoses and do so via the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) path-way, largely producing lactic acid as a by-product (Hammes and Vogel, 1995). Those species that are capable of homofermentation, but during starva-tion or glucose limitation can degrade pentoses and gluconate via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce acetic acid, ethanol and formic acid as by-products, are referred to as facultative heterofermentative  (FHE).  Finally,  the  obligate heterofermentative (OHE) group will metabolize pentoses and hexoses solely through the first part of the PPP via the phosphogluconate pathway and

produce lactic acid, CO2,and ethanol or acetic acid
(Holzapfel and Wood, 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2015). In the context of brewing, common BSR LAB belong to all three groups; for example, L. brevis and L. lindneri are OHE and L. plantarum is FHE. The different metabolic capacities of these isolates therefore may influence not only the style of beer or brewery location they are able to grow in as a result of available nutrients, but also the sever-ity and type of spoilage they cause as a result of their metabolic by-products.
To further illustrate lactobacilli diversity, Sun et al. (2014) characterized eight ‘niche type’ envi-ronments where lactobacilli are commonly found, including   plant   or   plant-associated   fermenta-tion products, sourdough, meat products, dairy products, wine products, human or animal gas-trointestinal (GI) tracts, human or animal non-GI sources, and the general environment. Notably, breweries or beer products are not included likely because  LAB  are  not  necessarily  an  essential component of beer fermentation or production. Further, many BSR LAB species can be isolated from different environments; for example, L. brevis has been isolated from the human GI tract, and L. lindneri and L. plantarum can be recovered from plant materials and dairy products (Salvetti et al., 2012), as well as from beer. The ability of differ-ent isolates of the same species to occupy multiple niches  and  exhibit  different  fermentation  types is common for Lactobacillus species (Douillard et al., 2013). Thus, it is not surprising that BSR LAB isolates occupying the same niche have different genomic features, underscoring the idea that differ-ent genetic mechanisms allow for adaptation to a given environment and/or stress (Sun et al., 2014).
As food production industries are principally concerned with LAB adaptation to their specific application   (i.e.   unique   environment),   LAB genomics  and  phylogenetic  relationships  have received  considerable  attention  (Hammes  and Vogel 1995; Salvetti et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011). Whole genome sequencing, phylogenomics and other bioinformatic approaches to compare LAB species have resolved questions of group diversity, evolutionary relatedness and provided a wealth of information concerning general genetic composi-tion. Multiple LAB genomes are available publicly through the National Center for Biotechnology Information   database   (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

genome), with over a hundred of these being Lac-tobacillus isolates and a dozen being Pediococcus isolates, and an estimated 80 unreleased, ongo-ing projects worldwide (Sun et al., 2014). These genomic data are of great general utility, however, with respect to brewing-microbiology, only a small percentage of these genomes or projects belong to BSR isolates (Bergsveinson et al., 2015c; Kelly et al., 2012; Pittet et al., 2012a,b). The continued sequencing of LAB genomes is essential, as general analysis of genomic content will be more robust and less inclined towards bias if LAB isolates from a variety of different sources are included (Pfeiler and Klaenhammer, 2007; Sun et al., 2014). As there is assumed genetic variation between BSR isolates from beer and non-BSR isolates, and BSR LAB species isolated from any source, more data must be made available for both BSR and non-BSR LAB from multiple isolation sources in order to effec-tively determine the evolution and distinguishing characteristics of BSR LAB.


Traditional and emerging methods for BSR LAB detection and identification

Culture-based methods
Culture methods are still the most commonly used approach for routine detection and identification of BSR LAB in the brewery, for reason of their ease of use, limited need for specialized training, relatively low monetary and space cost, and proven utility. However, culture methods have inherent disad-vantages, owing to the variable nature of BSR LAB isolates, e.g. differences in their fastidious aerotoler-ance or nutritional requirements, and the different adaptive states they may exist in when isolated from beer. These factors make the primary isolation of some LAB contaminants via growth quite difi-cult (Deng et al., 2014; Suzuki et al., 2008). More importantly, there is no single medium that effec-tively screens and supports growth for all possible beer spoilage LAB (Taskila et al., 2011).
de Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) medium (de Man et al., 1960), which was designed for the cultivation of LAB, remains the most relied-upon medium in brewery settings (Sakamoto and Konings, 2003). There are several descriptions of supplementing MRS medium with varying concentrations of beer,

expecting that the added beer enables cultivation of beer-adapted (hard-to-culture) organisms and that the nutrients provided by the MRS medium allow for more rapid growth (Haakensen et al., 2009b; Holzapfel, 1992; Suzuki et al., 2008b). Further modifications to beer-supplemented MRS include adding reducing agents to remove oxygen tension in the medium to facilitate the growth of a wide range of BSR LAB in addition to microaerophilic strains (Nishikawa and Kohgo, 1985; Taskila et al., 2010). Similarly, other developments such as the  Advanced  Beer  Detection  (ABD)  medium, developed by Suzuki et al. (2008b), seek to reduce medium osmolarity with the goal of isolating hard-to-culture BSR LAB.
Often there is a need to exclude other non-LAB brewing microorganisms from growing while con-currently enriching the medium to cultivate specific or hard-to-culture LAB isolates. Enrichment cul-turing prior to plating is a common technique to influence the number and identity of isolates grown and is often critical for the eficiency of downstream molecular detection techniques. Thus, contaminat-ing yeast or Gram-negative bacteria are excluded from growing in detection media by the inclusion of cycloheximide and 2-phenylethanol, respectively (Taskila et al., 2011). To select for specific or hard to cultivate BSR LAB, enrichment media are typically differentiated based on carbon sources present to exploit differences in substrate utilization between species (Endo et al., 2011). The most general sub-stitution that can be made is removal of glucose in favour of another carbohydrate, so as to limit the growth of very fast-growing LAB, thereby ‘levelling the playing field’, giving hard-to-culture isolates that are out-competed in most standard growth media a chance to grow (Endo et al., 2011). In addition, some metabolites produced by LAB, such as lactic acid or bacteriocins that have antimicrobial action, may also add to the selectivity of the enrichment cultivation (Moneke et al., 2009).
Ultimately, primary cultivation and even use of specialized culture media to detect and identify BSR LAB are not fully effective for the accurate detection of BSR LAB (Suzuki, 2011; Taskila et al., 2011). Nonetheless, culture methods remain an important area of investigation for the reason that  culturing  is  often  a  preliminary  step  for molecular analysis and because culture-based tests traditionally have provided the most information

for spoilage incidence reports, which has greatly influenced our current understanding concerning relevant BSR LAB.

Molecular techniques
Molecular methods typically have higher associ-ated cost and the need for specialized training, and thus have different utility for research or industry interests. Further, molecular methods can often be labour-intensive despite their ascribed benefit of being ‘rapid’, since pre-enrichment culture or isolation is often required before the molecular detection limit can be achieved or to remove inhibi-tory molecules found in beer (Back, 2005; Taskila et al., 2011). However, the allure of molecular tech-niques for the brewing industry is centred on their increased specificity and sensitivity in detecting and identifying BSR LAB. Recent reviews (Bokulich et al., 2012a; Bokulich and Mills 2012b) provide an extensive comparison of methodology concern-ing microbial community profiling in the brewing industry, and thus only a general overview of cur-rent community- or microbe-targeted molecular methods for BSR LAB analysis is presented here.

rDNA and RNA detection

PCR and qPCR
Many molecular techniques that seek to profile the  microbes  within  a  community  specifically target ribosomal genes or rDNA (i.e. 16S rDNA, 23S rDNA, rDNA inter-space regions) given the ubiquitous presence of rRNA (i.e. in both viable and non-viable cells) and the conserved nature of these sequences, enabling the ability to distinguish between species and isolates (Ben-Amor et al., 2007). As brewers are often solely interested in the presence of viable cells, other genes that increase the discriminatory power of these nucleic acid tech-niques, such as elongation-factor genes or other hop tolerance genes can also be targeted (Juvonen et al., 2010).
The  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  and various adaptations thereof are arguably the most frequently  used  means  of  performing  targeted-interrogations of the 16S rDNA and target genes of interest (i.e. hop tolerance genes) for BSR LAB (Haakensen et al., 2007; Pittet et al., 2011; Suzuki et al., 2004a,b). Perhaps the most important varia-tion of traditional end-point PCR for beer spoilage

LAB detection is that of the multiplex PCR assay, which is used to interrogate multiple targets at one time. Distinct primers targeting separate genes or regions of interest have been used within both the brewing and wine industry to profile hop tolerance genes and/or to rapidly identify LAB genera and species (Haakensen et al., 2008; Petri et al., 2013; Pfannebecker and Fröhlich, 2008). These tests give same-day results, require relatively low expertise to run, and have sensitive detection limits, thus pre-senting an attractive method for brewery use.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) usage has increased in brewery application because it allows the rapid quantitation of target DNA at an extremely sensi-tive level (such as from a single cell) (Bokulich et al., 2012a). The notable drawbacks include the high cost of the initial instrument and software, increased  expertise  required  over  conventional PCR, as well as concerns for quantitation accuracy given that the signal output does not discriminate living and non-living cells, and that results are influenced by the target gene copy number. Thus, an appropriately controlled and validated system is critical for drawing accurate conclusions. Since qPCR  is  not  a  community-profiling  technique, it has limited use in interrogating mixed-culture fermentations or unknown isolates. Nonetheless, qPCR allows for the accurate monitoring of both the presence and quantity of specific populations in the brewing environment, and has notable advan-tages over other methods in terms of analysis speed and achievable sensitivity. Reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) assays have also been developed which analyse actively transcribed mRNA content, and thus viable cells, such as for the detection of the BSR LAB hop tolerance genes, though these assays must still be stringently and appropriately controlled (Bergsveinson et al., 2012; Sami et al., 1997b; Haakensen et al., 2007).
PCR assays continue to be optimized as the methodology itself evolves. A recent application is droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), which operates on the principle of absolute target quantification without need for internal control genes or excessive reaction replicates (Hindson et al., 2011; Pinheiro et al., 2012). ddPCR was recently used to investi-gate the copy number of hop tolerance genes within a brewery setting (Bokulich et al., 2015). Though ddPCR is limited in the number of targets it can interrogate, and by its cost, it most certainly can be

further developed and applied to investigate gene target distribution and abundance within a brewery or contaminated sample (Hindson et al., 2011).

Molecular techniques
Several  techniques  apart  from  PCR  have  been developed  to  detect  specific  DNA  and  rDNA targets. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a method that targets singular or groups of iso-lates in a community and operates on the basis of  using  different  fluorescently  labelled  probes that hybridize to specific target regions (e.g. 16S rRNA) in a chemically fixed cell sample, followed by fluorescent microscopy (Bokulich et al., 2012a; Bottari et al., 2006). Based on the fluorescent sig-nals observed, populations of different cells can be assessed. However, this method is limited as to how many unique cell populations it can identify and is thus more suited for targeted-analysis. FISH can also be coupled to Flow Cytometry (FCM), which performs automated cell sorting based on fluorescent signals, which allows for the quantita-tion of different cells within a population. Together, these methods provide a semi-automated means of acquiring quantitative data within a few days for isolates of interest without the need for excessive pre-processing (e.g. DNA extraction). However, expensive equipment is required and the probes needed are often not commercially available (Boku-lich et al., 2012a). Therefore, FISH and FISH-FCM do not lend themselves well to in-house applica-tion for the brewery, yet provide interesting data when performed as an out-sourced procedure or in a research setting. Thus far, this methodology has only been well developed for characterization of yeast populations, with few reported studies of application to BSR LAB (Meng et al., 2012; Thelen et al., 2002, 2004). However, recent work involv-ing cider fermentations showed that FCM could distinguish and separate mixed yeast and bacterial cultures based on membrane integrity and esterase activity, and could identify different physiological states resulting from differences in fermentation conditions, thus having interesting implications for beer fermentations (Herrero et al., 2006).
While FISH (and/or FISH-FCM) are targeted-analysis methods, given they are limited by the number of probes that can be used during experi-mentation, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis

(DGGE) allows for a more robust identification of microbial community members through the 16S rRNA gene, and has been applied to beer-related LAB (Bokulich et al., 2012a; Manzano et al., 2005; Tsuchiya et al., 1994). This method uses universal PCR primers to amplify specific DNA sequences in a community, then separates the amplicons in a polyacrylamide gels containing a gradient of urea and formamide on the basis of differences in GC content  (melting  temperature),  thereby  allow-ing detection of DNA sequence heterogeneity in microbial communities (Bokulich et al., 2012a; Muyzer et al., 1993). Again, this method has lim-ited use within the brewery in that it is technically dificult and requires DNA extraction, and has a detection threshold that is often above the cell con-centration found in beer samples (Cocolin et al., 2001). Further, it requires subsequent processing and sequencing steps following the gel separation to produce accurate identification of the bacteria yielding the resolved bands, making it a laborious process fraught with the inherent errors and biases related to PCR amplification and DNA extraction (Bokulich et al., 2012a; Cocolin et al., 2001; de Lipthay et al., 2004).
Another very useful method for assaying micro-bial community diversity is Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP). Uni-versal PCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene that have been fluorescently labelled are used to amplify this DNA region from a mixed culture. Amplicons are then purified and in separate reac-tions, digested by one or more restriction enzymes, followed by capillary electrophoresis. The separa-tion of the fluorescently labelled DNA fragments allows for unique patterns to emerge for a given organism (Bokulich et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 1997). This method is flexible in terms of its ability to pro-vide either high throughput data or more targeted analysis of mixed microbial communities, and is relative easy to use with low cost, making it a more attractive option for routine use in contaminant surveillance within breweries (Bokulich and Mills, 2012a; Bokulich et al., 2012a). Further, this method can be adapted to provide greater resolution for specific BSR LAB targets through modification of the target sequences and restriction enzymes used (Bokulich et al., 2015).

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
The use of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has  increased  in  tandem  with  whole  genome sequencing in order to answer many questions of LAB relatedness and evolution (Enright and Spratt, 1999; Maiden et al., 1998; Sun et al., 2014). MLST relies  on  DNA  sequence  analysis  of  conserved housekeeping  genes  (or  other  protein-coding sequences) to type bacteria (Enright and Spratt, 1999; Maiden, 2008) and reveal insight into the overall diversity of a species. MLST has direct appeal to the brewing industry not only because of lower cost and required time compared to whole genome sequencing, but also due to the potential of distinguishing same-species isolates recovered from different sources and thereby the potential influence of the beer niche on genetic adaptations. However, in order to effectively develop MLST into a rapid means of screening for BSR versus non-BSR LAB, whole genome data provided by deep sequencing needs to be available to inform on specific assay targets.

Deep sequencing of DNA and mRNA
Genome sequencing, or in the case of microbial community  profiling,  meta-genome  sequencing, provides the entire genome or identity of each organism in the sample under analysis (Table 9.1). The amount of genetic information obtained by this technique is exponentially greater than provided by targeted-sequence analysis (i.e. of housekeeping genes or 16S rDNA). Given that a small handful of genes have not yet proven adequate to distinguish between BSR and non-BSR LAB, the wealth of data from deep DNA and mRNA sequencing is critical for better understanding of the total genetic character and higher-level metabolic regulation that differentiates these two groups of organisms and those LAB able to provide helpful fermentation for craft beers. Further, emerging patterns of species-or genus-level genetic content may be identified and then incorporated into routine brewery-level diagnostic approaches.
Applications  of  transcriptomics  or  metatran-scriptomics,   or   the   profiling   of   the   genetic expression   (mRNA)   within   an   organism   or community, is by far the most accurate means of studying genetic pathways required for growth in a

given condition, the interactions between members of a community such as quorum signalling, and overall process and stress regulation mechanisms (Bokulich et al., 2012a,b; Simon and Daniel, 2011; Warnecke and Hess, 2009). (Meta)transcriptomics builds upon genomics or metagenomics to reveal what  genetic  content  is  specifically  active  and therefore  important  for  growth  and/or  activity of a BSR LAB isolate on its own or in a microbial community (Bron et al., 2012; Table 9.1). Only three transcriptomic studies of BSR LAB isolates have been completed to date: on L. brevis BSO 464 in degassed and gassed beer, and on P. claus-senii ATCC BAA-344T during growth in beer with
undetermined dissolved CO2 content and on both
organisms grown in the presence of growth-limiting hop concentrations (Bergsveinson et al., 2016a,b; Pittet et al., 2013). These studies have revealed insights into not only the complexity of BSR LAB adaptation to the beer environment, but have also confirmed  the  importance  of  plasmids  for  the beer-growth phenotype. Further, these two studies indicate that cell membrane modification and nutri-ent scavenging (and general membrane transport) are critical responses to the beer environment, and further confirm the importance of biogenic amines production and metabolism as a common hallmark of LAB beer spoilage (Bergsveinson et al., 2016b; Geissler et al., 2016; Izquierdo-Oulido et al., 1996; Kalač et al., 2002). Overall, transcriptomic studies are beginning to reveal genetic adaptations shared by  BSR  LAB  and  indicate  important  next-step investigation efforts.
Deep-sequencing applications represent the cur-rent interface of academic research and industrial interests in the brewing field because though they are readily applied in a research setting, they do not presently lend themselves to routine use within the brewery. However, these technologies continually decrease in cost, and are currently being used in clinical settings, making it reasonable to predict that these methods will become part of routine practice in a variety of fields, including the brewing indus-try. Until such time, support of current academic research by the brewing industry is important, as omics data has the power to delineate specific markers for LAB beer spoilage ability, allowing for development of better detection methodology for brewery use.

Proteomics and metabolomics
The use of gas or liquid chromatography (GC or LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) to analyse the total protein, metabolite, or volatile compounds in a beer sample or microbial community can reveal insight  into  the  complex  process  of  microbial energy metabolism, quorum sensing, and protein production during fermentation and spoilage (di Cagno et al., 2011; Picariello et al., 2012). Further, these techniques can also be applied to resolve community proteomes, and investigate probiotic and bacteriocin production (Baugher and Klae-nhammer, 2011). These methods are beginning to be applied with greater frequency to BSR LAB (Behr et al., 2007; de Bok et al., 2011, Wieme et al., 2014), with notable recent application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to help characterize the microbial community of lambic beer and to distinguish between L. brevis isolates of different beer-spoiling virulence (Kern et al., 2014; Spitaels et al., 2014). Very recently, a com-prehensive analysis and comparison of metabolites present in beer during the growth of 26 LAB strains of varying beer spoilage strength was conducted with  high-performance  liquid  chromatography (HPLC) (Geissler et al., 2016). This study found that carbohydrate and amino acids metabolism did not correlate with spoilage potential of an isolate, but with fermentation type (heterofermentative/ homofermentative) and LAB species (Geissler et al., 2016). Further, a distinct amino acid metabo-lism  profile  was  observed  for  heterofermentive LAB, resulting in biogenic amine production, which is presumed to assist in maintaining energy supply and pH homeostasis (Geissler et al., 2016). These advances aside, the brewing industry lags behind other LAB-related fields in applying high-through-put protein analysis or sequencing techniques to solve the problem of LAB beer spoilage as well as help characterize useful LAB (Baugher and Klaen-hammer, 2011; Mozzi et al., 2013).


Methods of control
The use of omics approaches has the potential to reveal not only the nature and ecology of brewing-related  LAB,  thus  leading  to  better  diagnostic approaches, but to also provide information that

can be exploited as potential means of controlling both BSR LAB and non-BSR LAB.

Physical means
Control or intervention strategies for BSR LAB tra-ditionally have included the use of pasteurization, filtration, and chemical sanitation or detergents, although all these techniques can have undesirable outcomes or effects. For example, the use of high heat in pasteurization can cause denaturation or isomerization  of  important  flavour  compounds (e.g. hop-derived compounds) and decrease the ‘fresh’ taste of beer (Asano et al., 2007; Franchi et al., 2013). Further, filtration is not always efica-cious given that small LAB often escape (Asano et al., 2007; Back et al., 1992) and chemical means of sterilization presents a selective pressure for resist-ant contaminating bacteria and, based on toxicity, can have varying implications for safe use on equip-ment and for human contact (Deasy et al., 2011).
High-pressure  treatments  or  homogenization (HPH) represents a promising physical means of controlling contaminating microorganisms in beer and is used in other LAB-associated fields (Kheadr et al., 2002; Tribst et al., 2013). HPH forces molec-ular conformational changes in proteins, enzymes and polysaccharides, and damages the overall integ-rity of cell membranes, and has specifically been shown to inactivate the hop tolerance protein HorA in BSR LAB (Tribst et al., 2008, 2013; Ulmer et al., 2002). HPH treatment eficacy is influenced by not only the Gram character of the cell wall, but the cell size (Wuytack et al., 2002); however, Franchi et al. (2011, 2013) further characterized the conditions that facilitate effective HPH treatment for BSR LAB such that decreased pressure levels may be used for inactivation, thus increasing the utility of this approach for the brewer.

Bacteriocins
In  many  food-production  fields,  LAB-produced bacteriocins (antimicrobial peptides) are exploited for  their  ability  to  biologically  preserve  food through  elimination  of  other  microorganisms (Cintas et al., 2001; Cotter et al., 2005). Bacteri-ocins are a diverse collection of peptides and small proteins that have a wide range of activity against LAB and other Gram-positive bacteria (Cintas et al., 2001; Klaenhammer, 1993). In the brewing
Beer Spoilage LAB Using Omic Approaches |  255


industry, bacteriocins may eliminate other LAB or non-LAB beer spoilage organisms either through direct action against the cell or indirectly by con-tributing to the acidification of wort, making it less hospitable for bacterial growth (Lewis, 1998; Vaughan et al., 2005; Rouse and van Sinderen, 2008). The most studied bacteriocin in the context of brewing is nisin (Delves-Broughton et al., 1996; Vaughan et al., 2005); however, chitosan (Gil et al., 2004) and the bacteriocinogenic activity of the barley isolate Lactococcus lactic M30 have also been evaluated for use (Basanta et al., 2007).
Bacteriocins are an attractive means for control-ling BSR LAB growth, as they could be used in place of potentially harmful sanitizers or acid-washing which may affect yeast viability (Delves-Broughton et al., 1996; Ogden et al., 1988; Vaughan et al., 2005).  Further,  bacteriocins  theoretically  could be added at most stages of the brewing production process in order to target either specific contami-nated sites or introduce an inherent method of control (Delves-Broughton et al., 1996; Ogden et al., 1988; Vaughan et al., 2004, 2005). Interest in bacteriocins has increased to the point that there is potential to develop and use yeast starter cultures genetically modified to produce bacteriocins or develop wort bioacidifying LAB (Dequin, 2001; James et al., 2013; Van Reenen et al., 2003). This approach would potentially allow for the selection or development of LAB starter cultures suitable for use in craft-fermentations, such that the LAB involved eventually limit their own growth by the production of, or exposure to, bacteriocins.

Phage therapy
Bacteriophages and the products they produce have also been used for antibacterial action in a variety of food-industries and are gaining interest for appli-cation in the brewing industry (Kelly et al., 2011, 2012; Mahony et al., 2011, 2012). Bacteriophages are an excellent candidate for exploitation given that they are safe for human consumption, as they are specific to their bacterial host and are ubiquitous in nature (Park et al., 2011). Deasy et al. (2011) recently described L. brevis bacteriophage SAC12 with infectious activity against three L. brevis beer spoilage strains, which could effectively control the number of viable L. brevis cells present at a relatively high contaminant level. In light of the apparent suc-cess of bacteriophage therapy, further exploration

of this treatment for beer via either a singular agent or a cocktail of phage agents appears worthwhile. These investigations can be aided by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data of BSR LAB cells, which in turn will increase our understanding of both  bacteriophage-host  LAB  relationships  and LAB bacteriophage resistance.


BSR LAB and the brewing environment

Niche adaptation and horizontal gene transfer
Distinction  between  differently  adapted  LAB isolates lies not only with the analysis of the LAB core genomes, but also in the investigation of chro-mosomal sequences that appear to have originated in another species and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as plasmids (Broadbent et al., 2012). The  latter  two  genetic  features  are  frequently acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between isolates of the same or different species. By comparing recently divergent as well as ecologi-cally distinct genomes, it is revealed that HGT is important for the transfer of sequences or clusters of sequences, and drives the existence of diversifi-cation (Heuer and Smalla, 2007; Wiedenbeck and Cohan 2011). In fact, HGT events are promoted by environmental stress, resulting in faster adaptation or ‘short-term’ evolution in challenging environ-ments (Dziewit and Bartosik, 2014).
For LAB, HGT events mediated by plasmids are important to a variety of industries (de Angelis and Gobetti, 2011; Cai et al., 2009). In the brew-ing industry, conventional genetic markers of beer spoilage such as the exopolysaccharide gene gtf, and the hop tolerance genes hitA, horA, and horC are all plasmid-encoded and exhibit a very high degree of  sequence  identity  in  many  different  species (Suzuki, 2011; Walling et al., 2005). The existence of these markers suggests not only the occurrence and support of HGT in and by the brewery, but also the importance of investigating other plasmid-har-boured genes that demarcate BSR from non-BSR LAB.
Given that the ecological diversity among LAB appears to be driven in general by genome reduction mechanisms, the acquisition of niche-specific genes through the transfer of plasmids is an important
256 |  Bergsveinson and Ziola


area of investigation (Schroeter and Klaenham-mer, 2009). Indeed, recent omics-based studies support the notion that plasmids are important for conferring beer spoilage ability. New genomic data for several L. brevis isolates has revealed that an increased number of plasmids may correlate with the ability of isolates to withstand increasingly harsh and specific environments. For example, L. brevis KB290 originally isolated from a traditional Japanese fermented vegetable and also able to grow in simulated gastric and intestinal juices, has nine plasmids ranging in size from 5.8 to 42 kb (Fukao et al., 2013). Similarly, the rapid beer-spoiling isolate L. brevis BSO 464 has eight plasmids ranging from 2.3 to 85 kb (Bergsveinson et al., 2015a). These two isolates are incapable of growth in the other isolate’s niche-environment (J. Bergsveinson, unpublished), indicating that each possesses specific genes that do not confer immediate cross-resistance to another stressful environment; as such, these isolates have niche-specific tolerance genes. In contrast, the type strain L. brevis ATCC 367T only harbours two plas-mids (13 and 35 Kb) (Makarova et al., 2006) and is unable to spoil beer and cannot grow in gastric juices (J. Bergsveinson, unpublished; Fukao et al., 2013). This further suggests that increased plasmid-coding capacity likely supports the ability of L. brevis strains to infiltrate diverse environments. This idea is supported by a recent study showing that the sequential loss of plasmids from L. brevis BSO 464 results in loss of its original beer spoilage pheno-type, indicating that beer spoilage is mediated by specific plasmid-encoded functions (Bergsveinson et  al.,  2015a).  Similarly,  transcriptomic  analysis performed on BSR LAB L. brevis BSO 464 (Lb464) (Bergsveinson et al., 2016b) and P. claussenii ATCC BAA-344T (Pc344) (Pittet et al. 2013) reveals that several significant plasmid-based transcripts were active across their respective eight plasmids when in the beer environment, notably on the plasmids that already harbour hop tolerance genes (horC for Lb464 and horA for Pc344) (Bergsveinson et al., 2015a, 2016b; Pittet et al., 2010, 2013). Col-lectively, these results strongly suggest that specific plasmids  encode  previously  undescribed  beer spoilage-related functions and that detailed inves-tigation of plasmid genes in relation to growth in niche environments, beer, brewery, or otherwise, will prove useful.
Increased transcriptomic studies, in conjunction

with comparative genomics, will most accurately and fully reveal the importance of plasmid-medi-ated  functions  for  BSR  LAB.  Once  more  it  is emphasized, that for these data to be of utility to the brewing industry, this analysis must be performed with more frequency on BSR LAB of both same and different species. As the cost of this analysis decreases and bioinformatics tools become more sensitive (Thayer, 2014; Mardis, 2011), it will be possible to investigate the broad importance of widely conserved plasmid sequences in BSR LAB, as has been done for other niche-adapted organ-isms (Dziewit and Bartosik, 2014; Papadimitriou et al., 2015). Such analysis is reasonably expected to increase the number of species-independent, but  beer  spoilage-specific  genes  (and/or  their transcripts) that can be screened for during quality control routines in the brewery.

Origin of BSR LAB
Phylogenetics and comparative genomics can help answer questions on the evolutionary development of BSR LAB; however, the answer to how and when these isolates emerged likely lies within the brewery itself. BSR LAB likely emerged with inclusion of hops in beer between the fifth and ninth centuries (Suzuki, 2011; Tonsmeire, 2014). Following genetic adaptation to this specific stress, BSR LAB then adapted further and have since remained tightly linked with the brewing environment (Suzuki et al., 2008a; Suzuki, 2011). Indeed, BSR LAB isolates are rarely isolated elsewhere than breweries or beer, though non-BSR LAB isolates of the same species are (Suzuki et al., 2008a; Suzuki, 2011). Breweries thus are both the selective environment and the reservoir for their own contaminants.
A recent study by Bokulich et al. (2015) inves-tigated the distribution pattern of LAB species and putative hop tolerance genes in a brewery producing several different kinds of beer, using LAB-specific TRFLP (LAB-TRFLP) and ddPCR, respectively. The brewery involved produces ‘con-ventional’ beer (potential BSR LAB contaminants), sour  beer  (potentially  helpful  LAB  fermenters and/or BSR LAB) and coolship beer (BSR LAB and environmental microflora). The LAB-TRFLP applied in this study was found to more sensitively discriminate between species of the Lactobacillales order and most genera of the Bacillales order pre-sent in mixed culture (Bokulich and Mills, 2012a).

The LAB-TRFLP also identified organisms from other phyla not previously reported as recovered from beer, likely as a result of the fact the organ-isms in question are present at low abundance and are never actively selected for during detection (Bokulich et al., 2015). By applying this technique to analyse the LAB community profile through-out a brewery, Bokulich et al. (2015) were able to conclude that the brewery microbiota is probably driven by contact with raw substrates (grains, hops, yeast and beer), with this contact resulting in the profile of LAB present within a given brewery. For example, they found that wort samples contained a mixture of L. delbrueckii, L. hilgardii, L. sakei, Lacto-coccus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus spp., as well as a Bacillus spp., most of which were only rarely detected in other fermenting and bot-tled beer samples (Bokulich et al., 2015). Many of these species, while not necessarily found in finished beer, are apparently associated with grain and therefore their detection in wort is unsurpris-ing (Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013).
Interestingly, distinct LAB profiles from specific brewery samples were detected at different sites, presumably  as  result  of  potential  contact  with the beer sample. For example, sour and coolship beers were dominated by Pediococcus spp. and L. lindneri,  though  fermenters  and  barrel  surfaces that contacted these sour fermentations around the time of sampling exhibited similar community composition; however, L. brevis and Lactobacillus sp. were found to be more common on these sur-faces then on other surfaces or in the beer. Floor and  packaging  area  surfaces  contained  a  more diverse composition of LAB, with the predominant organisms being L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, and L. lindneri, which were also detected in the sour wort and beer. Perhaps most interesting was the finding that only Pediococcus spp. were detected on grain samples, while L. brevis, L. lindneri and Pediococcus spp. were recovered from hop pellets. This is noted as to be potentially due to the weak amplification from grain samples as a result of either inhibition of PCR by grain polyphenols or as a function of low LAB populations (Bokulich et al., 2015). Though the data gathered are of exceptionally high detail, ultimately this work cautions against ascribing raw substrates as causing contamination of all areas or equipment that share similar microbial community compositions, as there are alternative means for

microbial transfer within the environment such as fruit flies, or more likely, human activity (Bokulich et al., 2015).
Given the ubiquitous presence of LAB in and on natural sources such as plants and humans, it is likely that the introduction of specific LAB species into the brewing environment, and their prevalence and distribution throughout, is an outcome of the specific raw materials (grain, hop, water, yeast) used and is a further function of a given brewery’s spe-cific geographical location; facility history; recipe, processing, and production lines; and personnel hygiene. The individual nature of a brewery has been underscored by the analysis of LAB-contam-ination in Australian breweries wherein specific contamination was found to be associated more with the particular brewery, rather than with spe-cific antimicrobial challenges present by the beer sample that they were isolated from (ethanol, pH, hops) (Menz et al., 2010). The microbiological quality and hygiene of a brewery thus is apparently dependent more on production practices and sani-tation regimes than it is on the beer characteristics (e.g. highly hopped or alcoholic beers) (Menz et al., 2010).
The work presented in Bokulich et al. (2015) is  a  foundational  study  from  which  to  model further analysis of other breweries. Though it can be restated that the presence of LAB isolates and prevalence/distribution of them in a brewery will probably be brewery specific, ultimately an under-standing of where bacterial (LAB) contamination is taking place within a given brewery should allow for  the  identification  of  specific  contamination sources (i.e. raw materials vs. personnel) and help to strategize how best to prevent, or treat and recover contaminated product.


Hop resistance

Antimicrobial effect of hops
Beer and the brewery are stressful environments in toto, though hops are certainly considered the defining stress for microorganism growth. When hops are added to wort and boiled, alpha acids are extracted and transformed into iso-alpha-acids, the principal bitter components in beer (Steenackers et al., 2015). These bitter compounds have a dem-onstrated  antimicrobial  effect  on  Gram-positive
258 |  Bergsveinson and Ziola


bacteria (e.g. LAB), which was originally recog-nized to be through increasing the permeability of the bacterial cell wall, causing leakage of the cytoplasmic membrane, inhibiting normal cellu-lar processes, and causing changes in the cellular proton ionophore activity and uptake of leucine (Simpson, 1993a,b). Ultimately, bitter compounds act as ionophores, which sequester protons within the cell and dissipate the pH gradient across the cellular membrane, thereby reducing the proton motive force (PMF) and all PMF-dependent cel-lular activities, such as nutrient uptake (Sakamoto and Konings, 2003; Simpson, 1993a). Further, the strength of the inhibitory effect of hops was found to be dependent on pH and mediated by a cation (K+, Mn2+) exchange across the bacterial mem-brane (Simpson, 1993b). Importantly, these same mechanisms were not found to be active against Gram-negative  isolates,  probably  as  a  result  of the protection afforded by their outer membrane. Further investigation found that a transmembrane redox reaction of hop compounds occurred at low pH (such as in beer) and in the presence of Mn2+, and that this redox activity causes cellular oxidative damage (Behr and Vogel, 2010). Therefore, hop resistance is a multifactorial process where at least two distinct levels of resistance mediate the stress of hops, namely proton ionophore-induced and oxi-dative stress mechanisms (Behr and Vogel, 2010).

Hop tolerance mechanisms
To combat the intrusion of hop bitter acids into the cell, it has been suggested that hop-tolerant LAB  isolates  produce  higher  molecular  weight lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) in the cell wall as a response to hop presence (Behr et al., 2006; Suzuki, 2011; Yasui and Yoda, 1997). The change in LTA composition increases the natural barrier function of the cell wall, fortifying it against the damaging invasion of hop bitter acids (Suzuki, 2011). Fur-ther, these LTAs are purported to act as reservoirs of divalent cations (Mn2+) that can complex with hop bitter compounds as they move across the cell. The competitive binding of LTAs and Mn2+ limit the extent to which Mn2+–hop bitter com-pound complexes are formed, further reducing the potential effects of hops against the cell (Behr et al., 2006; Suzuki, 2011; Vogel et al., 2010). This layer of defence or resistance is probably passive and of very little energy burden to the cell if established

(Suzuki, 2011). Additionally, in a L. brevis model, it has been found that intracellular Mn2+-dependent enzymes are induced by the presence of hop bitter compounds and this induction may help to main-tain redox homeostasis and generate energy in response to a loss of PMF and depletion of Mn2+ reserves (Behr et al., 2007).  As these types of enzymes are responsible for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, this cellular response is targeted at ameliorating the oxidative stress induced by hop bitter acids (Behr and Vogel, 2010; Vogel et al., 2010).

Proposed hop tolerance genes
Potential genetic elements responsible for confer-ring some level of hop resistance to isolates have historically received a great deal of attention, given these elements would have utility for rapidly screen-ing and distinguishing BSR LAB from non-BSR LAB. Hop resistance genes described to date all share the characteristics of being plasmid-located and  having  gene  products  associated  with  the cytoplasmic membrane, working to either remove hop-compounds from the intracellular space or maintain cellular homeostasis (Suzuki, 2011).
The first gene described was horA, recovered from a L. brevis isolate (Sami et al., 1997a) and its product found to act as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that purportedly exports hop bitter acids out of the cell (Sakamoto et al., 2001). The  horC  gene,  also  originally  described  in  L. brevis, is predicted to function as a PMF-dependent multidrug transporter belonging to the resistance– nodulation–cell division (RND) superfamily that can export bitter compounds from the cell (Ijima et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2005). Interestingly, HorA and HorC can both confer resistance to multiple structurally unrelated drugs (Sakamoto et al., 2001; Suzuki et al., 2005). HorB is often included in some lists of hop tolerance genes, though its proposed function as the transcriptional regulator of HorC has not been convincingly confirmed (Bergsvein-son et al., 2012; Iijima et al., 2006). The third major hop tolerance gene described, hitA, is suggested to function in the uptake of divalent cations (Mn2+) following reduction of the intracellular concentra-tion of these cations by hop bitter compounds and thereby helping maintain Mn2+-dependent cellular functions (Hayashi et al., 2001). There have also been reports of two genes specific to Pediococcus
Beer Spoilage LAB Using Omic Approaches |  259


spp., bsrA and bsrB, which presumably also function as multidrug ABC transporters against the action of hop compounds (Haakensen et al., 2009c).
Although   the   mechanisms   of   action   and prevalence of these genes in LAB have been well documented, questions remain as to ability of these hop tolerance genes to absolutely describe the hop tolerance and overall ability of a BSR LAB to grow in and spoil beer. For example, there are reported cases of hop-tolerant isolates that do not possess any of the described hop tolerance genes (Behr et al., 2006; Menz et al., 2010), or isolates that harbour all three hop tolerance genes and are hop-sensitive (Back, 2005). In addition, the actual functionality and/or transcriptional activity of these genes in response to hop or beer stress have yet to be ana-lysed broadly and in depth using current molecular methods. One study utilized RT-qPCR to show that a L. brevis strain possessing all four genes (hitA, horA, horB, horC) and a P. claussenii strain possess-ing only horA and bsrA did not utilize these genes to the same extent during mid-exponential growth in beer (Bergsveinson et al., 2012). In fact, only horC showed significant expression in beer in L. brevis, while its transcriptional regulator horB was not similarly expressed, nor were hitA and horA. Com-paratively, P. claussenii demonstrated a significant expression of the horA gene and to a lesser extent, bsrA. Given these two isolates differ in their beer spoilage virulence, the transcriptional data raises the following questions. Does the possession of more than one hop tolerance gene correlate with increased hop tolerance and beer spoilage viru-lence? When all genes are present, are they utilized or active to different extents and potentially at different times during an isolate’s growth? Finally, what is the role of horB?
General hypotheses can be posed in response to these questions. First, there is evidence to suggest that the presence of more than one hop tolerance gene correlates with increased hop tolerance and potentially increased beer spoilage ability; however, these studies did not delineate whether all genes under analysis were complete, functional and/or active (Suzuki, 2011). Second, some results suggest that HorC is a major contributor to hop tolerance and is generally correlated with strong beer spoilage ability, and therefore might be the preferred mecha-nism of action (i.e. energy is spent transcribing this gene) in the face of hop or beer stress despite

the presence of the other hop tolerance genes (Bergsveinson et al., 2015a,c; Preissler et al., 2010). Alternatively, hop tolerance genes may not be nec-essarily transcriptionally active simultaneously and instead are activated in some sequential fashion, perhaps to reduce the cell’s energy burden. As the HorC transporter is dependent on the PMF and apparently active during mid-exponential growth in beer (in L. brevis), it could be that HorA and HitA, which act to either re-establish or maintain the PMF through removal of hop compounds or movement of divalent cations, could actually estab-lish optimal conditions for HorC activity and thus facilitate growth.
The  role  of  horB  was  previously  unclear. Although horB is nearly always found in conjunction with horC, it does not exhibit parallel transcription (Bergsveinson et al., 2012; Bokulich et al., 2015). Recently, it has been confirmed via RNAseq and ddPCR analysis that horB is a likely transcriptional repressor of horC activity, with active transcrip-tion of horB in nutritive or non-stressful growth conditions resulting in repressed horC expression (Bergsveinson et al., 2016a,b,c).

Hop tolerance genes and the brewing environment
Until a recent study by Bokulich et al. (2015), there was no previous analysis of hop tolerance gene dispersion in the brewery environment. This study made use of next-generation ddPCR to quantify the abundance of hitA, horA, horB and horC, in conjunction with associated microbial community profiles assessed by LAB-TRFLP on various brew-ery surfaces over time.
Firstly, this study determined that areas involved with sour beer production had the highest gene fre-quencies, specifically horC (Bokulich et al., 2015). This gene was the most abundant gene in general and was found in a nearly equal ratio with that of its putative transcriptional regulator horB, enforcing the notion that horC is an important and prevalent hop tolerance gene selected for in the brewing envi-ronment. The hitA gene had the lowest frequencies throughout the brewery, corroborating a previous report of low detected frequencies in BSR LAB (Haakensen et al., 2008). Indeed, hitA also had a lower correlation with the presence of the other hop tolerance genes, which shared amongst them-selves high degrees of intercorrelation (Bokulich et
260 |  Bergsveinson and Ziola


al., 2015). horA was the only gene correlated with Pediococcus in the brewery, supporting the previous observation that this gene is the primary known resistance gene for this genus (Haakensen et al., 2008). Most interesting was the fact that no genes correlated with L. brevis, which is not only con-sidered the most common brewery contaminant species, but has also been shown to be among the LAB most commonly positive for hop-resistance genes (Haakensen et al., 2008). However, given that L. brevis was only a minor component of sour beer and processing surfaces, this finding is probably particular to the brewery under analysis (Bokulich et al., 2015).
These results reveal the importance of tracking spoilage genes within the brewery environment in order to understand contamination risks and pat-terns, especially where more than one beer style is produced. For examples, barrel surfaces, ferment-ers and packaging-line surfaces (that all come into contact with beer) exhibited fairly high levels of hop-resistance genes with the highest detection on surfaces that contacted sour beers and in unsanitary areas such as the packaging-line sink and below the packaging belt (Bokulich et al., 2015). These findings are highly illuminating for development of brewery best practices, in that equipment for the production of sour or specialty beer must be spe-cifically dedicated and adequately separated from equipment used in conventional brewing. Further, contact with beer is strongly implicated in transmis-sion of hop tolerance genes and BSR LAB between different areas of the brewery; thus protocol and human activities must limit this transfer. Tracking transmission of hop tolerance (and other impor-tant genes) within the brewing environment is an incredibly worthwhile undertaking given that it will add insight into the role of environmental versus raw material contamination, and into the propaga-tion of hop tolerance genes and BSR LAB within the brewery (Bokulich et al., 2015).

Utility of BSR LAB hop tolerance genes
Questions remain concerning the utility of hop tolerance genes in predicting beer spoilage ability; however, there is no denying these genes are rel-evant to BSR LAB and the brewing environment.

The most notable feature of these genes is that they are not species-specific markers for hop-tolerance. For example, horA and horC (in addition to their flanking open reading frame (ORF) regions) are found to be well conserved in other BSR LAB iso-lates such as L. backii, L. lindneri, L. paracollinoides, P. claussenii, and P. damnosus, in addition to L. brevis (Iijima et al., 2007; Pittet et al., 2012; Suzuki et al., 2004a, 2005, 2011). It has even been reported that these two genes are found at rates as high as 94% and 96% of BSR LAB tested and that all strains have at least one of the genes (Suzuki, 2011). Caution is required; however, since the full gene length of hop tolerance genes is rarely sequenced in brewery settings; therefore, the sequence similarity, let alone the functional integrity of these genes, is rarely guaranteed.
Though targeting hop tolerance genes currently remain  the  strongest  discriminatory  method  to detect intra-species differences in beer spoilage ability (Iijima et al., 2007; Sami et al., 1997b), these genes are still unable to predict the beer spoilage capacity of the full spectrum of BSR LAB that have been described. Unfortunately, to date, there are few data suggesting alternative hop tolerance genes or mechanisms in the absence of any of hitA, horA, or horC (Menz et al., 2010). This lack of compensatory theories is frustrating in light of the physiological  variability  (hop-tolerance,  growth phenotype) between strains that have identical hop tolerance genes profiles; other uncharacterized hop tolerance mechanisms must exist (Haakensen et al., 2008, 2009c; Menz et al., 2010). Since the known hop tolerance functions are ABC transporters or eflux pumps, and since both types of transporter are common within LAB (Konings et al., 1997; White et al., 2012b), it is short-sighted to not con-ceive of other similar genes and proteins across the spectrum of BSR LAB that deal with hops directly or indirectly, or that deal with other stresses in beer. Indeed, given the multitude of stress in beer, the ability to grow in and mediate the damage of both beer and hops, is probably the result of a synergy of mechanisms and redundant genetic traits. Until more  detailed  and  high-throughput  analyses  of these processes are conducted, we remain hindered in our capacity to screen for elements that describe true beer spoilage ability.

Stress tolerance and adaptation of BSR LAB
There is considerable literature that discusses gen-eral and specific stress responses of LAB in a variety of industries. Though stress tolerance can differ among isolates of the same species, LAB are highly adaptable to stressful environments and adaptation to one particular stress often affords LAB increased tolerance to the challenge of another stress, due to the cross-regulation and functions of stress-response pathways (de Angelis and Gobetti, 2011; Parente et al., 2010). BSR LAB isolates exemplify complex  stress-response  regulation  given  that isolates  must  simultaneously  employ  tolerance mechanisms to a variety of stresses.

Stress tolerance to ethanol and low pH
Ethanol levels and pH differ among styles of beer worldwide, typically within the ranges of 0.5–14% (v/v) ethanol and pH 3.8–4.7 (Suzuki et al., 2008a). As a consequence, LAB recovered from beer within or outside these ranges are typically well adapted to one or both of these stresses (Suzuki, 2011). Further, most BSR LAB produce either lactic or acetic acid due to their basic fermentation, which naturally lowers the pH of the surrounding environ-ment. Indeed, it has been reported that decreased pH and increased ethanol in beer had little effect on the growth of LAB, and that there is no correla-tion between these two factors and contamination, though pH values near 4.0 or below had some inhibitory effect on LAB (Menz et al., 2010). None-theless, adaptation to the acidity found in beer is necessary, as low pH can interfere with enzymatic reactions, protein folding and other intracellular processes of non-pH-tolerant organisms. LAB, and other pH-tolerant organisms are capable of regulat-ing their intracellular pH in face of acidic conditions through means of proton transport across the cel-lular membrane (often coupled to cation transport) or through proton-translocating ATP synthase (de Angelis and Gobetti, 2011).
Ethanol, like hops, is an antimicrobial com-ponent  of  beer,  easily  crossing  the  bacterial membrane and then modifying activity of cyto-plasmic  processes  such  as  protein  folding  and inhibiting enzymatic actions. Ethanol also increases cell membrane permeability through alteration of the polarity of aqueous and hydrophobic regions

of the phospholipid membrane, causing leakage of small molecules from the cell and cell death (Ingram,  1990).  Various  tolerance  mechanisms may combat these effects, such as membrane fortifi-cation through an increase in long-chain fatty acids (>20  carbons)  (Uchida,  1974).  Other  general stress-response proteins such as the GroES chap-erone, heat-shock proteins (HSP), and glutathione reductase (Fiocco et al., 2007; Silveira et al., 2004) confer  increased  survival  during  ethanol  stress, as well as to other stresses (Angelis and Gobetti, 2011). For BSR LAB, it has been found that ethanol tolerance does not differ significantly between BSR and non-BSR LAB, and that overall LAB ethanol-tolerance  levels  were  species-conserved,  unlike beer spoilage capacity (Pittet et al., 2011). Though BSR LAB adaptation to low pH and ethanol are important, it does not appear that either is neces-sarily predictive of the ability to tolerate hops, nor ability to spoil beer (Bergsveinson et al., 2015a,b; Menz et al., 2010; Pittet et al., 2011).

Stress tolerance to low nutrient availability
Yeasts are used to consume and ferment nutrients in wort following the breakdown of grain starches during  the  malting  and  mashing  processes,  in order to produce ethanol. Yeasts can make use of the majority of sugars present in wort, in addi-tion to using available amino acids as a source of   nitrogen,   in   a   sequence   usually   depend-ent on both the strain of yeast and conditions used (Lodolo et al., 2008; Perpete et al., 2005). Organic acids (acetic, citric, lactic, malic, pyru-vic and succinic acid) are left behind by yeasts as metabolic by-products, in addition to unused compounds such as dextrins, arabinoxylans and β-glucans (Gupta et al., 2010). Remaining nutrients in beer following fermentation are typically in low abundance and are often ‘alternative’ sources of carbon that can vary from brew to brew within and between breweries.
LAB  naturally  have  an  array  of  possible mechanisms to transfer nutrients into the cell, thus allowing them to inhabit various nutrient-rich or -poor environmental niches. In nutrient-depleted beer, primary nutrient transport via the use of ATP-binding-cassette	(ABC)	transporters	is proposed to allow for advantageous growth (Kon-ings, 1997). These transporters typically have high
262 |  Bergsveinson and Ziola


afinity for a given solute and use ATP-hydrolysis for high-rate transport. Further, secondary trans-port mechanisms, not requiring ATP but relying on the electrochemical ion gradient to transport mol-ecules across the membrane, involves uniporters, antiporters and symporters for effective uptake of molecules (White et al., 2012b). In some cases, this uptake can even contribute to the production of energy through contribution to the PMF gradient (White et al., 2012b). Lastly, group translocation, a mechanism that chemically modifies a solute that has been internalized can also facilitate the uptake of a range of carbohydrates (White et al., 2012b).
There is considerable evidence for the impor-tance of each type of transport uptake mechanism for BSR LAB. First, there is a great number of ABC  transporters  among  LAB  in  general,  and the importance of these proteins for BSR LAB is probably not yet fully appreciated beyond hop tol-erance mechanisms (Konings et al., 1997). Second, recent transcriptomic work on P. claussenii ATCC-BAA344T (Pc344) when grown in beer revealed the importance of both secondary transport systems (e.g. the arginine or agmatine deiminase pathways, citrate fermentation) and group translocation such as the phosphotransferase system (PTS) (Pittet et al., 2013). Components of all these systems were actually found to be among the top 20 most sig-nificantly expressed transcripts in beer, suggesting the critical role of nutrient-acquisition pathways for survival in beer (Pittet et al., 2013). Interestingly, the  significantly  expressed  agmatine  deiminase pathway (AgDI operon) in Pc344 is very similar to the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway, which is not specific to nutrient-stress, but has been shown to be up-regulated in response to low pH and acid stress,  low  oxygen  concentration,  low  arginine supply (6mM) and cell adaptation to arginine in L. sanfransciscensis (de Angelis and Gobetti, 2004). Though the ADI operon is not found in Pc344, the similar AgDI operon was shown to be critically important for survival in the beer environment, and is a major example of the cross-specificity of LAB stress responses. Finally, another example of cross-resistance is the induction of stationary phase in LAB when faced with nutritional starvation, at which point the cells become more resistant to stresses such as heat and acid (Angelis and Gobetti, 2011; Gouesbet et al., 2001).

Stress tolerance to low O2 tension and dissolved CO2
The low oxygen levels in beer selects for microbes capable of anaerobic respiration. LAB, specifically Lactobacillus and Pediococcus isolates, can produce energy in the absence of oxygen by using other electron acceptors to regenerate NAD+ or by sub-strate-level phosphorylation during fermentation for the regeneration of NAD+ (White et al., 2012a). Fermentation capacities in anaerobic conditions are known to be different across subgroups, even genera, of LAB, nonetheless, the overall anaerobic nature of BSR LAB facilitates their resistance to the stress of low oxygen.
Recently, it was shown that the presence of
headspace  pressure  and  dissolved  CO2  (dCO2)
limits the ability of LAB to grow in and spoil beer (Bergsveinson et al. 2015b). Transcriptomic
analysis of dCO2-tolerant isolate L. brevis BSO 464
during growth in packaged beer has since revealed that this environment strongly induces modifica-tions to cellular transcriptional regulation, and to both the cell membrane and wall, relative to what occurs in unpackaged beer (Bergsveinson et al., 2016b). This finding strongly suggests that further analysis of changes in the cell membrane lipid
profile of dCO2 beer-tolerant BSR LAB may reveal
signature alterations, or biomarkers of tolerance to the packaged beer environment and beer in general. Such information is important, since it is reason-able to expect brewery-adapted BSR LAB to be able to withstand the sudden, additional stress of high
dCO2 as a result of headspace flushing with CO2
during packaging.

Viable, but not culturable, state
A general adaptation to the beer environment by BSR LAB is the modification of both cell size and morphology. Diminished cell size and a notable rounding or shrinking of bacilli or rod-shaped cells (i.e. taking on a coccoid appearance) have been noted for several BSR LAB isolates following beer-adaptation (Asano et al., 2007). This phenomenon has been proposed to be an attempt by the cell to reduce surface area in contact with beer and to help  membrane-associated  tolerance  genes  (e.g. hop tolerance) deploy more eficiently (Suzuki et al., 2006; Suzuki, 2011). Furthermore, increased time in beer results in induction of a viable, but not

culturable (VNBC) state in LAB cells. Such cells are not detectable by routine non-beer culture media on which they would normally grow colonies, but are alive and capable of renewed metabolic activ-ity through continued exposure to routine media (Deng et al., 2014; Oliver, 2005). Understanding both the conditions inducing the VBNC state in a variety of different BSR LAB and how to retrieve the culturable phenotype more eficiently is of extreme utility to brewers in accurately detecting where BSR LAB exist in their brewery. Investiga-tion into the genetics and transcriptional activity of BSR LAB throughout their VNBC cycle would also increase the understanding and be of upmost importance for a wide range of industries depend-ent on LAB.

Maintenance of BSR LAB and importance of biofilms
The mapping of BSR LAB and hop tolerance genes in the brewery by Bokulich et al. (2015) illustrates the risk of cross-contamination between different equipment  surfaces,  especially  in  environments where  conventional  and  sour  beer  types  are produced. Cross-contamination of surface areas supports the increase in diversity of the present microbial community, as well as the development of biofilms, thus probably driving spoilage inci-dence at various production stages (Matoulkova et al., 2012; Timke et al., 2005, 2008; Storgårds et al., 2006).
The brewing industry has great concern about biofilms, given that they can be established not only in the brewery, but also in draft beer dispensing lines outside the brewery, which brewers usually do not monitor, nor control (Timke et al., 2005; Thomas and Whitham, 1997). Though biofilms are typically comprised of a variety of microorganisms, they have a known correlation with product-spoiling bacteria and thus require prevention and attention (Timke et al., 2005; Zottola and Sasahara, 1994). Increased analysis of brewery biofilms would be of great util-ity, especially given that biofilms may be highly individualistic and thus require specific or adapted control treatments. Though some specific strains of LAB have been shown to be able to form biofilms (Kubota et al., 2008), in general, Gram-negative bacteria (and yeasts and moulds) are among the first to colonize surfaces in the brewery, while LAB are opportunistic colonizers that benefit from the

multiple  interactions  within  already  established communities,  especially  if  the  biofilm  provides reduced oxygen levels and an acidic environment (Stornsgard et al., 2006).
Involvement in biofilms also increases the likeli-hood of acquiring genetic material advantageous for the brewing environment through HGT (Kubota et al., 2008; Timke et al., 2005). Biofilm-mediated transfer of beer spoilage virulence genes is evi-denced by the finding of plasmid-harboured hop tolerance genes among many LAB species, with the interspecies nucleotide sequence identities of these genes and surrounding regions being highly conserved at approximately 99% (Suzuki et al., 2005, 2008a; Suzuki, 2011). Indeed, a 5.6kb region that contains horA was found to be 100% identical in L. backii and P. inopinatus strains isolated from the same brewery (Iijima et al., 2007) and this same phenomenon is identified in other horA+ isolates recovered from different sources (Pittet et al., 2012a; J. Bergsveinson, unpublished data). As such, HGT among LAB in biofilms is believed to be how hop tolerance genes, and other putative plasmid-mediated  beer  resistance  elements  are spread within breweries (Suzuki, 2011).

Screening physiological capacities of BSR LAB: contaminant versus fermentor?
It is obvious that beer spoilage is not a binary phenotype mediated by the presence/absence of one or even a few genes, as antibiotic resistance or other phenotypes like motility most often are (Schwarz et al., 2014). Instead, BSR LAB isolates exist on a scale of beer-spoiling virulence, just as LAB isolates in other industries sit on a continuum of capabilities and eficiency in performing a task (Mozzi et al., 2013). Indeed the extent to which a LAB isolate can grow and metabolize is important for its classification as either a contaminant or fer-mentor. Contaminants are considered thus because their growth is at once unexpected, and uncontrol-lable by the environmental conditions posed by production of a given beer; however, the damage they impose on the beer product is relative across isolates as a result of their growth ability and meta-bolic by-products. On the other hand, ideal LAB participants in sour beer fermentations contribute some specific flavour component(s), but do not over-produce these compounds through cellular
264 |  Bergsveinson and Ziola


overgrowth, as this leads to flavour imbalance (i.e. spoilage). Thus, to prevent a helpful LAB isolate from being considered a contaminant, either the genetic makeup or surrounding environment of an isolate must limit its own growth and metabolism.
The relative ability for LAB to establish rapid growth in beer or produce flavour compounds in a moderate fashion is genetically based, which strongly points to subtle differences in the genet-ics and metabolism of BSR LAB and fermenting LAB. However, these changes are not readily inter-rogated using targeted analytical methods such as MLST. To distinguish contaminant from helpful isolate, the analytical method must be able to take into account the influence of the total beer environ-ment (i.e. available fermentable sugars and other
nutrients, ethanol levels, hop levels, pH, dCO2)
when describing the beer spoilage virulence of a given LAB. Thus, it is only through the use of meta-genomics, global transcriptomics and pheno-type correlation, that researchers and the brewery industry will be able to effectively profile helpful, fermenting  LAB  for  development  of  new  beer product, as has been done in other non-brewing industries. For example, efforts are under way to preform en masse genome analysis of LAB Oeno-coccus oeni isolates relevant to the wine industry, in order to link genotype with an isolate’s winemaking properties and wine characteristics (Bartowsky et al., 2011, 2014; Borneman et al., 2013a,b). Linkage analysis allows for the distinction between content diversity (specifically, gene presence/absence) and genome diversity (organization, regulation, plas-mid and phage presence) and their link to overall isolate phenotype such as flavour profile produced. Importantly, this large-scale analysis ameliorates the  potential  bias  that  isolate-selection  has  on between-isolate  comparisons  (Cai  et  al.,  2009; Pfeiler and Klaenhammer, 2007; Sun et al., 2014).
Within  the  brewing  industry,  non-academic institutions  are  beginning  to  conduct  analyses similar to those of White Labs Ltd (San Diego, CA, USA) who are analysing brewing yeast genomes in relation to the flavour profile of beers that the yeasts impact (Herkewitz, 2014). It is reasonable to expect that comparable analyses could be per-formed not only for LAB in relation to the styles and composition of beer they are able to spoil, but also for the characterization of helpful, fermenting LAB for sour beer production and for defining LAB

exhibiting beneficial interactions with yeast in spe-cialty brews.


Conclusions and the future
The demonstrated variability of LAB as to genetics, niche-adaptations, and stress tolerance, together with the individuality of brewery environments leads to the conclusion that single episodes of BSR LAB contamination cannot be considered exemplary. Unfortunately, historical preoccupation with a select few exemplary isolates, brew styles, and physiological stresses means that the sum total of current BSR LAB research does not adequately describe the dynamic event that is LAB-related beer  spoilage.  Examples  of  shortsightedness  or incomplete information about BSR LAB include the following:

1    Although the total beer environment is rec-ognized as stressful for microbial growth, the
effect of dissolved CO2 on LAB growth has not
been studied to the same extent as for the other described stresses in beer.
2	There has been virtually no investigation of the multiple beer stresses simultaneously as to their effect on BSR LAB physiology or gene transcription.
3	The  presence  and  role  that  pervasive  or common bacteriophages might have in estab-lishing  BSR  LAB  communities  as  well  as patterns of bacteriophage resistance remain unknown.
4	No data are available on the role of redundant genetic mechanisms that may operate in BSR LAB to deal with the individual, let alone the simultaneous growth stresses found in beer.
5	Only  minimal  efforts  have  been  made  to describe non-traditional BSR LAB or to dis-cover the full spectrum of microbial diversity in breweries.
6	There is limited understanding of how shifts in beer composition (nutrient levels, processing conditions, small changes in ethanol or hops) affect the survival of BSR LAB or microbial communities.

Further, when considering these examples of where research on BSR LAB is needed, it must be emphasized that the brewing industry lags behind
Beer Spoilage LAB Using Omic Approaches |  265


other  LAB-fermentation  industries  such  as  the dairy/cheese and wine industry in understanding both  product-fermenting  and  product-spoiling LAB isolates, how they behave within a microbial community, and if these interactions are influenced by raw substrates as well as the brewing process.
To address these issues and enlarge the data avail-able on BSR LAB, the brewing industry must align more closely with advances made in other LAB industries. Concurrently, omics-based technologies must be applied to the study of BSR LAB within both academia and the brewing industry. Not only is the power and versatility of these technologies well  demonstrated  for  interrogating  microbial processes, but the simple utilitarian perspective remains that these methods clearly provide more information through fewer experimental trials than other approaches. For example, as opposed to using classic methods (laborious processes with need for excessive replication) to investigate the presence or absence of a gene and the correlation to a specific physiological trait, the use of metatranscriptomics together with metagenomics can reveal patterns of gene activity in relation to growth environment and phenotype – and do so for multiple isolates with fewer procedural steps.
Support for application of such broad scale omics analyses to brewery LAB contamination has come from recent research, which has strengthened the call for a shift in research paradigm from targeted-analysis  to  community-analysis.  To  begin  with, and most importantly, genomic and transcriptomic analyses of BSR LAB isolates have firmly called into question the utility of the few known hop tolerance genes as indicators of LAB beer spoilage potential, and have begun to indicate other potential genetic markers of beer spoilage or bacteriophage content that could be potentially exploited for control of BSR LAB. Further, microbial community analysis using next-generation PCR applications and sen-sitive molecular methods has indicated that this type of analysis is critical to perform for brewer-ies producing multiple brew styles, particularly to determine and then modify personnel-driven con-tamination patterns with the brewery. Additionally, this analysis has begun to reveal the presence of unique microbes not yet described in brewery set-tings that must be explored for their potential to contribute via HGT beer spoilage resistance genes to LAB found in the brewery setting.

Concerns of accessibility of omics technolo-gies for those who work within brewery settings expose an interesting developing niche within the industry – for commercial or academic laboratories that can provide omics services to breweries and assist with interpretation of omics data. The emer-gence of such an approach represents an important evolution in the intersection of academia and the brewing industry. Based on the established progres-sion of omics accessibility (i.e. decreasing cost, with increasing ease of use) there is a foreseeable future wherein brewers readily rely on these technologies for investigating incidences of spoilage, as well as for obtaining information needed for product inno-vation.
Ultimately, the two main issues that remain endemic to BSR LAB research are the dogma that a few select genes are responsible for conferring beer spoilage ability and that a handful of BSR LAB species can be used as models for investigating all matters of LAB spoilage. Current omics results already point to the fallacy of these two dogmas and future research is expected to provide confirmation. In this context, it is important to note that omics approaches can be used to search answers to criti-cal remaining questions. Specifically, are there are other conserved plasmid sequences transferred in brewery HGT events? How do BSR LAB interact with one another within microbial communities (metabolome, quorum sensing), and how do these interactions influence the relative proportions of the microbes present? How or what is the connec-tion between genomic content and the good or the bad or ugly, physiological capacities of BSR LAB? Finally, how can omics technologies be exploited to screen for helpful brewing LAB, and help us under-stand as well as control their contribution to beer flavour and interaction with brewing yeasts? Appli-cations of omics approaches to BSR LAB truly have the potential to quickly and exponentially expand our understanding of these bacteria.
The reality of the highly adaptable and variable nature of LAB, and the selective and individual environment of a given brewery, guarantee that LAB-contamination will continue to pose a threat to the global beer industry. Undoubtedly, improved brewery hygiene has increased the general stability of beer products; however, the current industry environment fosters competition and innovation, thus necessitating not only the production of new
266 |  Bergsveinson and Ziola

beers, but often of different types of beer simulta-neously within a given physical plant. This means there  are  developing  layers  of  complexity  and new challenges to maintaining a known, stable, and  controlled  microbial  brewing  environment. Community-scale analysis together with increased application of omics approaches for troubleshoot-ing, general research, and innovation is the only way to keep pace with these demands.

Abstract
As indicated by the chapter title, growth of selected Gram-negative bacteria in beer results in an unpalat-able product, leading to consumer complaints, and loss of brewer and brand loyalty. Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria historically have been a major problem for brewers, but with improved packaging methods resulting in reduced oxygen levels in beer, these bacteria now are mostly found in improperly attended draft beer systems. Concurrently, reduced oxygen in packaged product resulted in emergence of the anaerobic Gram-negative spoilage bacteria, particularly those within the genera Megasphaera and Pectinatus. Little is known about the genetics of these anaerobic bacteria, given that minimal omics-based research has been done on them. This chapter presents the historical aspects of brewing-related Gram-negative   bacteria,   where   the   anaerobic brewing-related bacteria likely originate from and where they are found within breweries, and the evolution of molecular-based approaches for the rapid detection and identification of these bacteria for brewery quality control. Finally, application of metagenomics, genomics, and transcriptomics for improved understanding of brewing-related Gram-negative bacteria is discussed from the perspectives of bacterial persistence within breweries as well as growth in and spoilage of beer.

Introduction
Bacteria inevitably find their way into the brewing environment, whether via the raw materials used in making beer, environmental sources (e.g. air or water), or the individuals working in a brewery or where draft beer is offered. Regardless of its source and mode of introduction, once a bacterium is established within a brewery or draft beer distribu-tion site, eradication is dificult, resulting in a high probability  that  the  organism  will  periodically emerge and cause beer spoilage, e.g. as off-flavours, aromas, or turbidity. Although the Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) causing problems for brewers and beer comprise a number of bacterial genera and species, only two physiologically functional groups are involved. The first is comprised of bacteria growing under aerobic, or at least microaerophilic conditions, and the second consists of bacteria that are essentially strict anaerobes.
Selected aerobic GNB bacteria can be found in the brewery at all stages of beer production, except in packaged product where current-day packaging methods involve the removal of oxygen and crea-tion of a restricted headspace, effectively resulting in an anaerobic environment (Jandreau and Hahn, 1978; Kuchel  et  al., 2006). These bacteria can also be found growing at post-packaging points of opened kegs or draft beer dispensing lines if

appropriate procedures to restrict oxygen entry and maintain hygiene are not observed. Aerobic GNB, by definition, are not a problem for packaged beer in which oxygen has been virtually eliminated. The situation for the anaerobic brewery-related GNB is the exact opposite, with these bacteria causing spoilage of oxygen-depleted packaged beer, but generally being unable to grow well at other points in the beer production process due to the presence of variable levels of oxygen. Although anaerobic GNB are more restricted in their brewery growth niche, brewers fear them much more than their aerobic counter-parts, as growth of anaerobic GNB is accompanied by stronger markers of beer spoil-age: turbidity and strongly offensive off-flavours and aromas. Experiencing even one episode of such spoilage will emphatically affect a consumer’s beer and brewery loyalty.


Aerobic GNB

Enterobacteria
Historically, numerous aerobic GNB have been found to spoil beer through production of off-flavours and turbidity. Included here is the coliform group of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae, with beer spoilage isolates occasionally identified as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. (e.g. E. aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae), Escherichia coli, Hafnia alvei, Hafnia protea (formerly Obesum-bacterium proteus), Klebsiella spp. (e.g. K. aerogenes, K. pneumonia) or Rahnella aquatalis (earlier often confused  with  E.  agglomerans)  (Greipsson  and Priest, 1983; Hamze et al., 1991; Martens et al., 1991; Priest et al., 1973, 1974; Van Vuuren et al., 1978). These bacteria are considered to be wort spoilers (Priest et al., 1974) and in standard beer production, growth of these aerobic bacteria in nutrient-rich wort at pH 5 to 6 can cause off-flavours through production of 2,3-butanediol, acetate, for-mate, and dimethyl sulfide, along with low levels of fusel alcohols (Priest and Hough, 1974; Priest et al., 1974; Van Vuuren et al., 1980). The result is sweet fruity or vegetable-like (celery or cooked cabbage) flavours. Ironically, many of the bacterial species viewed as wort-spoilers are obligatory for the initial open air-seeded fermentation process leading to production of traditional Lambic beer (Bokulich et al., 2012; Martens et al., 1991; Spitaels

et al., 2014; Van Oevelen et al., 1977). In contrast, for current industrially produced lambic beer, the early Enterbacteriaceae phase is absent, with acetic acid bacteria instead playing a larger role (Spitaels et al., 2015).
Most  of  the  enterobacteria  that  have  been described as wort-spoilers do not survive in the later stages of fermentation, as they are susceptible to the increased ethanol, and lower pH and oxygen levels. E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, H. alvei, H. protea, and R. aquatalis can better tolerate a higher ethanol, and lower pH and oxygen environment (Jespersen and Jakobsen, 1996), and thus are more problem-atic for brewers than other enterobacteria. This is primarily due to the possibility of these bacteria being carried into subsequent fermentations when yeast is pitched. Improved brewery hygiene, care-ful attention to sterile handling of wort through proper cleaning (decontamination) of transfer lines and tanks, and reduced yeast pitch rate (i.e. more frequent preparation of new fermentation yeast inoculant)  have  contributed  to  greatly  reduced brewery problems with enterobacteria.

Acetic acid bacteria
Although aerobic (or microaerophilic) acetic acid bacteria are ubiquitous, it is specifically at the dis-pensing point for draught beer that the acetic acid bacteria Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Gluconobacter oxydans most often pose a prob-lem (Bamforth, 2005). If air enters a keg or if beer stands on tap too long, suficient oxygen may be present for growth of acetic acid bacteria. These bacteria produce acetic acid from the ethanol in beer and also can produce a ropy slime or surface pellicle. Isolates from the genus Acetobacter can fur-
ther metabolize the acetic acid to CO2 and water,
while Gluconobacter isolates cannot. Because of their oxygen growth requirement, acetic acid bacte-ria, much like enterobacteria, have been eliminated almost entirely as a problem in modern breweries. Nonetheless, the recent description of a new acetic acid bacterium Gluconobacter cerevisiae isolated in a brewery environment indicates the necessity for continued vigilance by brewers for this group of GNB (Spitaels et al., 2013).

Zymomonas mobilis
The remaining beer spoilage GNB that can grow in the presence of oxygen is Z. mobilis. In fact, this
Brewery- and Beer Spoilage-related Gram-negative Bacteria |  277


organism can grow aerobically or anaerobically, and actually shows increased ethanol tolerance if growth is occurring without oxygen present (Moreau et al., 1997). Z. mobilis grows optimally at 25–30°C and is rarely found in larger breweries due to the 8–12°C fermentation temperatures used. Additionally, the organism has stringent carbohydrate requirements (sucrose, glucose, or fructose) from which it makes
quantitative amounts of ethanol and CO2. The main
beer spoilage situation for Z. mobilis is cask-condi-tioned, primed beer with added sugar for achieving carbonation. Spoilage is caused by turbidity and the synthesis of variable levels of acetaldehyde and hydrogen sulfide, which together give a rotten apple or fruity smell, and an ester or sulfur flavour (Dadds et al., 1971; Richards and Corbey, 1974). Interestingly, Z. mobilis is used in making alcoholic beverages in tropical locations (e.g. African palm wine and Mexican pulque), and is being actively investigated for potential usage in fuel alcohol pro-duction (Kosaric et al., 1982; Rogers et al., 2007).


Anaerobic GNB
The notion attributed to the ancient Greek phi-losopher Aristotle that Nature abhors a vacuum is exemplified by the emergence in the 1970s of beer spoilage by a group of related anaerobic bacteria. As brewers reduced oxygen levels in packaged beer to increase shelf life (Kuchel et al., 2006), two things happened concurrently. First, as oxygen levels in beer went down, the role played by aerobic GNB decreased to the point that spoilage occurrences by these organisms became a rarity. At the same time, the increasingly anaerobic environment in beer allowed for certain oxygen-intolerant GNB to emerge and dominate as beer spoilers. Given the current importance of beer spoilage by anaerobic relative to aerobic GNB, the remainder of this chap-ter will focus on the anaerobic group of bacteria.
At present, brewers are concerned with pos-sible spoilage of packaged beer by nine species of anaerobic bacteria in four genera, including Meg-asphaera  (cerevisiae,  paucivorans,  and  sueciensis), Pectinatus (cerevisiiphilus, frisingensis, and haikarae), Propionispira (genus formerly named Zymophilus; paucivorans and rafinosivorans), and Selenomonas lacticifix (Engelmann and Weiss, 1985; Juvonen and Suihko, 2006; Lee et al., 1978, 1980; Schleifer et al., 1990; Ueki et al., 2014). The Megasphaera and

Pectinatus spp. are reasonably well studied, while little research has been done on the Propionispira spp. and Selenomonas lacticifix.

Megasphaera and Pectinatus
The first of the anaerobic GNB to be associated with beer spoilage was P. cerevisiiphilus (Lee et al., 1978, 1980). Subsequently, P. frisingensis and P. haikarae were also defined as beer spoilage organ-isms (Juvonen and Suihko, 2006; Schleifer et al., 1990). A similar situation occurred for the three Megasphaera spp. now known to spoil packaged beer, with M. cerevisiae being described initially (Engelmann and Weiss, 1985), and M. paucivorans and M. sueciensis defined later as beer spoilage spe-cies (Juvonen and Suihko, 2006). Retrospectively, all six species appear to have emerged as anaerobic beer spoilers in the 1970s, with isolates early on often misidentified as being the initially described species in each genus (Haikara et al., 1981; Weiss et al., 1979).
When  found  to  cause  beer  spoilage,  Megas-phaera and Pectinatus are generally isolated from non-pasteurized,  packaged  beer  (Back,  1994) having lower alcohol levels and slightly higher pH. Pectinatus spp. appear to tolerate beer with ethanol up to 4.4% (w/v), while Megasphaera spp. are less ethanol tolerant, thought to grow only in beer with ethanol levels of 3.5% (w/v) or below (Haikara and Helander, 2006). Recently, however, an isolate of M. cerevisiae able to tolerate 5% (w/v) ethanol has been described (Bergsveinson et al., 2017). Pectina-tus isolates can tolerate beer with a pH of 4.0–4.5, while Megasphaera isolates start to show restricted growth at pH 4.5 (Haikara and Helander, 2006). Physiological growth data indicate P. frisingensis is more acidophilic than P. cerevisiiphilus, which makes this species more of a beer spoilage threat (Tholo-zan et al., 1996, 1997). Finally, while low oxygen content is critical for the growth of Pectinatus and Megasphaera in beer, physiological differences exist between  these  bacteria,  with  Pectinatus  isolates being more aero-tolerant than Megasphaera isolates (Chowdhury et al., 1995; Haikara and Helander, 2006; B. Ziola, unpublished). Clearly, a combina-tion of factors influence whether or not a particular packaged beer can support growth of Pectinatus or Megasphaera.
Beer spoilage by Pectinatus and Megasphaera invariably involves severe turbidity, particularly so
278 |  Ziola and Bergsveinson


for Pectinatus (Lee et al., 1980). In addition, these bacteria cause offensive off-flavours and an obnox-ious aroma due to the synthesis of variable levels of acetic, butyric, proprionic, caproic, isovaleric, and valeric acids; as well as acetoin, hydrogen sulfide, and methyl mercaptan (Foster and Andersen, 1999; Haikara et al., 1981; Lee et al., 1978, 1980; Membré and  Tholozan,  1994).  For  beer  with  Pectinatus contamination, the resultant smell is most often that of rotten eggs, while the usual smell associated with Megasphaera growth is strikingly reminiscent of barnyard faecal waste slurries (particularly por-cine), which is even more strikingly malodorous. Growth of these bacteria in beer occurs best at temperatures above 15°C (Haikara et al., 1981), so occurs in packaged beer stored unrefrigerated. While the severe turbidity and terrible smell asso-ciated with spoilage is generally enough to cause consumer  dissatisfaction,  actually  sampling  the spoiled beer makes the experience much worse. The ultimate bad experience, never to be forgotten by a consumer, is the spilling of the spoiled beer on clothes or skin, as the horrible smell involved is dif-ficult to remove even with repeated washing. Given the negative consumer outcome of experiencing spoilage by Pectinatus and Megasphaera, it is little wonder that brewers fear these bacteria. The good news for brewers globally is that the proportion of packaged beer spoilage due to these bacteria peaked in the later 1980s and early 1990s at values approaching 30% for Pectinatus and 5% for Megas-phaera (Back, 1994, 2003; Paradh et al., 2011). This is most likely due to improved brewery hygiene and increased vigilance for these bacteria in breweries.

Propionispira (formerly Zymophilus) and Selenomonas
When the three species for these two genera were first  described,  all  isolates  were  from  pitching yeast or undefined brewery waste; none were from contaminated beer (Schleifer et al., 1990). In the intervening years, no definitive information has been forthcoming which associates P. paucivorans, P. rafinosivorans, or S. lacticifix with growth in packaged product. Of the three bacteria, S. lacticifix appears to be the most likely to be a beer spoiler, since laboratory modelling work has shown this bacterium can grow in beer with a pH of 4.3 to 4.6. In contrast, P. paucivorans and P. rafinosivorans require a higher pH of 6.0 or 5.0, respectively, for

growth in beer (Seidel-Rüfer, 1990). As such, these bacteria are considered to be indicator microbes, whose detected presence within the brewery is indicative of a breakdown in brewery hygiene.
Accumulating evidence points to plants as the environmental origin for the nine currently defined anaerobic GNB species found in breweries. The initial  indication  that  these  bacteria  are  plant-associated came from analyses showing that their lipopolysaccharides contain unusual carbohydrate structures showing similarity with what is found in plant-associated Rhizobium spp. (Helander et al., 2004). The first direct evidence for such plant association was provided by the finding of P. cer-evisiiphilus in samples of mangrove sediment in Thailand (Saimmai et al., 2012). About the same time, two new, albeit non-brewing-related Pectina-tus species, P. brassicae (Zhang et al., 2012) and P. sotticetonis (Caldwell et al., 2013) were isolated from pickle waste water and spoiled pickles, respectively, Finally, a recent metagenomics analysis of a root sample from a sedge plant (Carex spp.) collected in a wetland at high altitude in the Tien Shan Moun-tains in the Issyk Kul region of Kyrgyzstan revealed that Propionispira spp. comprised some 25% of the bacterial population present (M. Haakensen and V. Friesen, Contango Strategies Ltd; personal com-munication). As sequencing the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene that was done on the sample does not allow P. paucivorans and P. rafinosivorans to be differentiated, identification to the species level could not be done.


Location in the brewery: biofilms and microbial communities
Anaerobic  GNB  most  likely  have  long  been brewery inhabitants and emerged as beer spoilers when the conditions in beer permitted anaerobic growth, rather than these bacteria coming into breweries  coincidentally  with  the  implementa-tion of improved beer packaging which produced greatly reduced oxygen content. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the same temporal emer-gence of spoilage by Pectinatus and Megasphaera in well-separated countries on different continents. Pectinatus spp. are widely distributed, perhaps due to their slightly higher oxygen tolerance than Meg-asphaera spp. Pectinatus spp. have been isolated in breweries in at least a dozen countries, including
Brewery- and Beer Spoilage-related Gram-negative Bacteria |  279


the USA; Japan; Finland, Norway, and Sweden; Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; and most recently, the Czech Republic (Lee et al., 1978; Matoulková et al., 2012b; Paradh et al., 2011; Suikho and Haikara, 2001). In contrast, Megasphaera isolates have been reported in fewer, but still widely separated coun-tries,  including  in  Australia,  Finland,  Germany, Sweden,  and  the  United  Kingdom;  and  most recently, Canada (Bergsveinson et al., 2017; Paradh et al., 2011; Suikho and Haikara, 2001).
Additional evidence for Megasphaera and Pecti-natus having a long-term association with breweries is based on the relative ease and frequency with which these bacteria are found. The recent papers by Paradh et al. (2011) and Matoulková et al. (2012b) document this, as isolation of Megasphaera and Pectinatus (particularly P. frisingensis) was read-ily achieved directly from beer, and even fermenting wort and yeast slurries, and from various sampling points within the brewery packaging environment. Both research groups emphasized that Megasphaera and Pectinatus are likely maintained within bio-films in the brewery and if stringent cleaning and hygiene are not maintained, such biofilms persist, continually acting as a potential source from which the bacteria can spread and contaminate yeast sus-pensions, fermenting wort, and most importantly, packaged  beer.  That  at  least  Pectinatus  isolates appear to be able to spread via aerosols within the brewery emphasizes the need for continued vigilance for the presence of biofilms and anaerobic GNB in all areas of a brewery, not just in the filling area (Back, 1994).
It has been suggested that brewery biofilms containing anaerobic GNB also include aerobic bacteria and yeast (to consume the oxygen in the immediate locale), as well as lactic acid bacteria (LAB; to provide lactate used as a carbon source for the anaerobic GNB growth) (Back, 1994). The frequent finding of both LAB and anaerobic GNB within a given brewery setting fits with this sce-nario (Back, 1994; Paradh et al., 2011). In contrast, research specifically focused on microbes compos-ing biofilms has not been as supportive, in that anaerobic GNB were found in only 3 of 78 samples taken from the bottling areas of two breweries in one study (Timke et al., 2005a) and in none of the samples similarly collected from a single brewery in a second study (Timke et al., 2005b). In contrast,

a  more  recent  analysis  of  58  isolates  obtained from sampling biofilms in a single brewery filling hall were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS, and P. frisingensis and S. lacticifex were identified 3 and 19 times, respectively (Vávrová et al., 2014). This variability in frequency of anaerobic GNB isola-tion and identification is probably primarily due to differences in hygiene operating procedures in the different breweries sampled in the respective stud-ies. Of secondary importance are the sampling and bacterial identification methods used. The limited and variable information available strongly suggest the need for more research on the role of biofilms in maintaining anaerobic GNB in the brewery setting.


Isolation, detection and identification
When  Megasphaera  and  Pectinatus  are  isolated from brewery samples, it is invariably as a mixture with yeast, aerobic bacteria, and/or Gram-positive bacteria. In an effort to enhance selectivity for Megasphaera and Pectinatus, specific growth media have been developed, including SMMP medium, which contains lactate as the sole carbon source and  reducing  agents  to  promote  the  anaerobic growth by Megasphaera and Pectinatus (Lee, 1994). Added cycloheximide, alcohol, and crystal violet together with sodium fusidate inhibit growth of yeast, aerobic bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. A more recently described selective Pectinatus growth medium consists of a modified de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) medium with cysteine hydrochloride  and  sodium  thioglycolate  added to lower the redox potential to enable anaerobic growth, and a mixture of tetrahydroiso-alpha-acids and 2-phenyethanol to inhibit growth of other organisms. Bacteriological agar is added at a sub-solidification level to prevent medium oxidation during use over time (Matoulková et al., 2012a). Although not tested, it is likely that Megasphaera would also grow in this medium. Once Megasphaera and Pectinatus spp. have been purified by plating on anaerobic MRS agar in Gas Pak chambers, isolates of both genera can readily be grown in MRS broth that has been autoclaved in tubes with a minimum headspace and the tube caps immediately tightened before the medium cools (SY Lee, personal com-munication; Pittet et al., 2014).
Starting either with contaminated beer samples

or following growth of brewery samples in isolation medium, the question then is whether Megasphaera or Pectinatus spp. are present. If these bacteria are present in high levels, scent alone can indicate their presence, particularly if a Megasphaera isolate is involved. For breweries with gas chromatography capability, confirmation can be obtained of the obnoxious  volatile  compounds  present  due  to the metabolism of Megasphaera or Pectinatus spp. (Foster and Andersen, 1999). More recently, a lipidomics approach to detecting Megasphaera or Pectinatus in brewing samples was described, with electrospray  ionization  tandem  mass  spectrom-etry  used  to  detect  plasmalogen  phospholipids (Řezanka et al., 2015). As plasmalogen phospholip-ids are found in anaerobic bacteria and not yeast or plant materials, this methodology allows detection of GNB in brewing samples, but without further identification to the genus level.
When  considering  not  only  detection  but identification of Megasphaera or Pectinatus spp., from a brewery microbial quality control perspec-tive it is important to know whether beer spoilage is the result of a newly introduced bacterium or re-emergence of a strain that already comprises part of the existing brewery microbial community. Also, when Megasphaera or Pectinatus are present at low levels in brewery samples, more sensitive and targeted approaches than just smell are required. However, the methods that have been developed to meet this criterion vary in both sensitivity and ability to answer whether a detected Megasphaera or Pectinatus isolate is new to or re-emerging in a brewery.
Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody-based systems have been described for detection of Meg-asphaera and Pectinatus (Gares et al., 1993; Haikara, 1985; Ziola et al., 2000). There is some evidence that the age of the cells trapped by filtration influences subsequent detection by an immunofluorescence antibody test, at least if polyclonal antiserum is used (Haikara, 1985). Provided monoclonal anti-bodies specific for surface-exposed antigens of the bacterial cell are used, bacterial levels as low as 2–4 cells per 10ml of contaminated beer were detect-able by fluorescence immunoassays following filter concentration of the cells (Gares et al., 1993). As long as the bacterial cells are intact, age of the cells is not a factor, as they are easily visible by micro-scope scanning. It should be noted that monoclonal

antibodies which are strain or species subgroup specific are readily derived, making them useful in determining whether the Megasphaera or Pecti-natus isolate in question is new to or re-emerging in a brewery. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies showing species- or genus-specific reactivity are much more dificult to obtain. Not surprisingly, this dificulty in obtaining monoclonal antibodies with broader binding specificity is reflected when poly-clonal antiserum is used instead. Overall, polyclonal antibodies (whether mouse or rabbit) against a given Megasphaera or Pectinatus isolate generally do not work well in filter-based bacterial cell-surface immunofluorescence assays. This is because of a high assay background signal and the dificulty in generating  antiserum  showing  isolate-,  species subgroup-,  species-  or  genus-specific  reactivity (even following extensive adsorptions in attempts to remove different kinds of bacterial cross-reacting antibodies; B. Ziola, unpublished).
The first application of omics to the brewing-related  anaerobic  GNB  involved  sequencing  of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes, and the rRNA gene interspacer DNA with the overall aim of developing DNA-based methods for detection with concurrent identification of these bacteria at the species level (Juvonen et al., 1999; Motoyama and Ogata, 2000; Sakamoto et al., 1997; Satokari et al., 1998). These tests work well for cells following pre-enrichment growth in isolation medium, and recently have been extended to the detection of the two Propi-onispira (formerly Zymophilus) spp. and S. lacticifix (Felsberg et al., 2014, 2015). In an attempt to apply this methodology to contaminated beer samples where Megasphaera or Pectinatus cells can be low in number, concentration of the bacteria by membrane filtration has been done prior to DNA extraction (Juvonen et al., 1999; Juvonen and Haikara, 2009). As PCR inhibitors are found in beer, numerous pre-treatments of the filter-trapped cells as well as PCR additives have been tested, with addition of bovine serum albumin and polyvinyl pyrrolidone proving useful in reducing the effect of PCR inhibitors in beer (Juvonen and Haikara, 2009).
In an effort to increase assay eficiency, from the perspective of potentially obtaining more data per reaction, multiplex PCR methods based on 16S rRNA gene sequences have been described for the brewing-related anaerobic GNB (Iijima et al., 2008; Juvonen  et  al.,  2008).  Such  assays  incorporate
Brewery- and Beer Spoilage-related Gram-negative Bacteria |  281


multiple primer sets that yield PCR amplicons of different sizes or melting curves, thus enabling a range of species to be identified with a single reac-tion. DNA sequences other than the 16S rRNA gene can be used in such a multiplex PCR approach as was recently demonstrated with the gene for the major outer membrane protein found in the three Pectinatus spp. used as the PCR target (Pittet et al., 2014). Indeed, any gene with inherent variability involving deletions, or insertions, or even multiple nucleotide changes if clustered, can find utility in such a multiplex PCR. For Pectinatus spp., another gene that appears to meet the criteria for targeting via a multiplex PCR is the flagellin gene (Chaban et al., 2005). In the case of Megasphaera spp., no gene has been sequenced for all three brewing-related species. Nonetheless, the readily extractable outer membrane protein from M. cerevisiae isolates exhibits size variability, suggesting the gene for this protein has the potential to fulfil the role as the target in a multiplex PCR for identifying Megas-phaera spp. (Ziola et al., 2000).
Ribosomal  operon-based  PCR  methods  also have been described that incorporate restriction enzyme-digestion of the reaction amplicons, fol-lowed by fragment size assessment in an approach termed ribotyping (Juvonen et al., 2008; Motoyama et al., 1998; Suihko and Haikara, 2001). Not only can identification of the brewing-related anaerobic GNB be done to the species level, but also to the subspecies and even in some cases to the strain level. Using conserved genes such as the rRNA genes or other so-called housekeeping genes are not ideal as PCR targets for determining whether a contami-nant is a new strain or an existing strain of anaerobic GNB within a given brewery. This is because such genes, by definition, show only slow and thus lim-ited change in genetic sequence. Instead, genes that show considerable sequence variability are better suited in this regard as exemplified by the Pectinatus flagellin and major outer membrane protein genes (Chaban et al., 2005; Pittet et al., 2014). Once either of these genes has been sequenced for a given Pectinatus isolate, a PCR; for example, a probe-based real-time PCR can be readily assembled for detecting re-emergence of that isolate in a brewery. Viability of the bacterial cells being detected in a brewery setting is a consideration if the cells being detected have not been subjected to pre-enrichment

growth in isolation medium. A DNA oligonucleo-tide microarray has been described for the detection and identification of viable beer spoilage bacteria, including anaerobic GNB (Weber et al., 2008). Here the ribosomal interspacer DNA is the bind-ing target, with determination of bacterial viability based on the correlation between growing cells and the presence of pre-rRNA that includes the rRNA interspacer region.
If the focus of microbial quality control within a brewery is on whether there has been a break in brewery hygiene, then the assays deployed need not be bacterial strain, species or even genus spe-cific, and viability of any detected contaminate is not important. In this case, using a DNA-based rapid method for beer spoilage bacteria writ large will sufice. As the vast majority of brewing spoil-age is caused by bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum (i.e. both the Gram-positive bacteria dealt with in the previous chapter and the anaerobic GNB discussed here), detection of a brewery hygiene break can be accomplished by a 16S rRNA-based PCR designed to detect all Firmicutes (Haakensen et  al., 2008). Combining the Firmicutes-specific PCR primers with a primer that binds only to the 16S rRNA gene of Gram-negative Firmicutes allows concurrent determination of a detected Firmicutes bacterium as being either a Gram-positive or an anaerobic Gram-negative organism (Pittet et al., 2010).


Common structural features, genes, and genomes
Despite  their  Gram-staining  characteristics,  the anaerobic brewing-related GNB are taxonomically placed with the low-GC Gram-positive bacteria in the Firmicutes phylum. This placement occurs whether the phylogeny is based on rRNA gene sequences (Juvonen and Suihko, 2006; Schleifer et al., 1990; Stackebrandt et al., 1985) or, for Pec-tinatus spp., when the much more variable flagellin protein sequence is used (Chaban et al., 2005). While the brewing-related GNB were originally all placed in the class Clostridia within the Firmicutes, more recent taxonomic analysis has placed Megas-phaera sp. in a new class called Negativicutes within the Firmicutes (Marchandin et al., 2010). Since phylogenetic analyses place all the brewery-related
282 |  Ziola and Bergsveinson


anaerobic GNB close together taxonomically, it is expected that these bacteria will possess a wide range of common features.
From an omics perspective, comparing a group of bacteria, or even one bacterium to another, is best done starting with a comparison of global genome sequences.  Unfortunately,  for  the  nine  species of brewery-related anaerobic GNB, only the two strains of M. cerevisiae (Bergsveinson et al., 2017; Kutumbaka et al., 2015) and one strain of P. rafino-sivorans (Kyrpides et al., 2013) have been genome sequenced, with the data publicly available through the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Thus far, no research has been published using these three genome sequences. At least four and seven non-brewing-related Megasphaera spp. and  Selenomonas  spp.,  respectively,  have  been genome-sequenced and the data deposited with the NCBI. Included here are four distinct isolates for each of Megasphaera elsdenii and Selenomonas ruminatum. As such, there already is a reasonable amount of comparative genomic data available for the non-beer spoilage immediate relatives of the brewing-related anaerobic GNB when additional genomes  of  the  latter  organisms  do  become sequenced.
Except   for   the   ribosomal   operon-related sequences used for establishment of the DNA-based detection and identification methods already described, no other DNA (i.e. genes) universal to all nine brewing-related anaerobic GNB have been sequenced. The only genes investigated in any detail for these bacteria include the Pectinatus flagellin gene (Chaban et al., 2005; Hakalehto et al., 1997) and the gene for the Pectinatus major outer mem-brane protein (Pittet et al., 2014). Given the few brewing-related anaerobic GNB DNA sequences that have been analysed, it is not surprising that no gene expression (transcription) analysis has been performed on any of these bacteria.
That brewing-related anaerobic GNB ultimately will be shown to have common genetics is predi-cated on the anaerobic growth properties of these bacteria  and  what  is  known  of  their  structural components. The research leading to the initial description of many of these bacteria determined that they possess an unusually thick layer of directly cross-linked meso-diaminopimelic acid peptidogly-can containing cadaverine and putrescine as major and minor components, respectively (Engelmann

and Weiss, 1985; Haikara et al., 1981; Schleifer et  al.,  1990).  Commonality  of  moieties  in  the peptidoglycan of these bacteria was later found through epitope mapping of peptidoglycan-specific monoclonal antibodies (Ziola et al., 1999). A total of nineteen monoclonal antibodies were analysed and found to map to four distinct binding sites on the peptidoglycan. Monoclonal antibodies specific to each of the four sites were documented to bind to six of the nine currently described anaerobic brewing-related GNB, with the remaining species M. paucivorans, M. sueciensis, and P. haikarae not tested as these spp. were recognized subsequently. While it seems likely that cadaverine and putres-cine would each be part of one of the four defined antibody-binding  sites  involved,  this  hypothesis remains untested.
Although the brewing-related anaerobic GNB are  classified  taxonomically  in  the  Firmicutes phylum  alongside  the  Gram-positive  bacteria, these microbes contain an outer membrane and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) like other GNB. The LPS of Pectinatus isolates have been well character-ized (Helander et al., 1983, 1994, 2004) and shown to be rich in fatty acids and possess considerable heterogeneity, with several distinct molecules pro-duced by an individual strain. Pectinatus LPS also contains unusual carbohydrate structures consist-ing of what is essentially a conserved core region carrying  a  large  non-repetitive  polysaccharide, which replaces the usual O-specific chain (Vino-gradov et al., 2003). Again, similar to the bacterial peptidoglycan, monoclonal antibodies have shown that the LPS from all brewing-related anaerobic GNB  contain  common  structural  features  not found in other GNB. Using spleen cells from mice immunized and boosted with ethylenediaminetet-raacetic acid extracts from different M. cerevisiae isolates,  four  monoclonal  antibody  hybridomas were  isolated  secreting  antibodies  that  reacted with a surface-accessible antigen on all M. cerevisiae isolates. Further testing revealed that at least two distinct binding epitopes are recognized by the four monoclonal antibodies and that these epitopes are also present in M. elsdenii as well as P. cerevisiiphilus, P. frisingensis, P. paucivorans, P. rafinosivorans and S. lacticifix, (Ziola, 2016). Since all four monoclonal antibodies show reactivity with the bacterial surface in a surface immunofluorescence test with intact cells as the antibody binding target, the conserved

antibody binding sites are most likely in the unusual large distal carbohydrate in the LPS. This common-ality in a LPS-related structural feature among these bacteria points to yet another metabolic pathway and, hence, genetics, that they have in common.


Conclusions and the future
Beer spoilage by anaerobic GNB clearly is a problem for the brewing industry that waxes and wanes, but is not going away, meaning continuous attention to brewery hygiene is essential if these unwanted bacteria are to be kept out of beer. In contrast to the emerging use of omics to study the Gram-positive LAB that can spoil beer, as described in the preced-ing chapter, omics approaches have yet to be truly applied in studies of the anaerobic GNB of interest to brewers. Compared to the Gram-positive lacto-bacilli and pediococci beer spoilage bacteria, the brewing-related anaerobic GNB are the poor coun-try cousins waiting their turn in the omics spotlight.

Although only briefly touched upon here, physi-ological responses of the brewing-related anaerobic GNB have been studied broadly with summaries of the information available in review form (Hai-kara and Helander, 2006; Suzuki, 2011). To make better sense of the physiological data that has been accumulated, it is essential to have in-hand genome sequences for the bacteria involved. For example, having sequenced genomes for each of the nine anaerobic brewing-related GNB would allow elu-cidation of the genetics required for the synthesis of the common aspects of the peptidoglycan and LPS these bacteria exhibit. However, with only the genomes of two isolates of M. cerevisiae and one iso-late of P. rafinosivorans so far available, the sequence cupboard is essentially bare. To remedy this, at least the type strains of the other seven brewing-related anaerobic GNB should have their genomes sequenced and assembled. Beyond that, several additional Megasphaera and Pectinatus brewery iso-lates should have their genomes sequenced because the majority of the available physiological data on the anaerobic brewing-related GNB has been done with isolates of these two genera. With multiple genome sequences available it would then be possi-ble to start doing the genome comparisons that will

underpin understanding of the different metabolic activities  among  the  brewing-related  anaerobic GNB. Since several isolates of closely related non-brewing Megasphaera spp. have had their genomes sequenced, including four strains of M. elsdenii, comparisons against genome-sequenced brewing-related anaerobic GNB would begin to reveal the genetic characteristics of these bacteria needed if growth in beer is to occur.
Genome sequencing for isolates representing the full spectrum of the brewing-related anaerobic GNB will also provide information pertinent to two other interesting areas of investigation. First, since these bacteria are classified as Firmicutes, what is it about the genetics of these low-GC Gram-positive  bacteria  that  fits  with  both  true Gram-positive organisms and true Gram-negative organisms?  Genome  sequence  analyses  in  this regard have a good probability of providing addi-tional insights into the evolution occurring among the existing spectrum of brewing-related bacteria. Second, genome sequencing of the anaerobic GNB will most certainly provide information on whether plasmids play a role in the growth of these bacteria in beer. It has long been suspected that plasmids obtained via horizontal gene transfer play a major role in the growth of lactobacilli and pediococci that are beer spoilers. Direct evidence for the impor-tance of plasmids in beer-spoiling organisms was recently obtained by curing various plasmids from the rapidly growing beer spoiler Lactobacillus brevis BSO 464 and finding that growth in beer and hop resistance were dramatically reduced with the loss of particular plasmids (Bergsveinson et al., 2015). Whether  the  brewing-related  anaerobic  GNB indeed even have plasmids must first be answered by genome-sequencing of different isolates; only then can the question be approached of whether plasmid-harboured genes contribute to the growth in and spoilage of beer by these bacteria.
Once  genome  sequences  for  the  anaerobic brewing-related GNB become available, then the power of transcriptomic approaches can come into play. With the availability of different genomes of these bacteria and their close non-spoilage rela-tives, gene expression analysis of genes of interest can be performed. The alternative is to undertake global  transcriptional  analysis  of  given  bacteria grown under specified growth conditions. In the initial instance, an enormous amount of data can
284 |  Ziola and Bergsveinson


be obtained by determining global gene transcrip-tion when a bacterium is growing in beer compared to growth in routine laboratory medium. Subse-quently, the gene expression required to handle each of the growth stresses encountered by a bac-terium when growing in beer can be individually determined. As described in the preceding chapter, such studies are beginning to take place for the LAB that spoil beer (Pittet et al., 2013; Bergsveingson et al., 2016a,b), but have yet to be undertaken for any of the brewing-related anaerobic GNB.
As the acidic pH, alcohol, and dissolved CO2/
pressure found in packaged beer are generally suf-ficient to inhibit the growth of most GNB, it would be of particular interest to determine the genetics allowing the brewing-related anaerobic GNB to handle these stresses when growing in beer. In fact, it would be of interest to compare gene transcrip-tion of the aerobic and anaerobic GNB in relation to growth in beer. Including hops as one of the growth stresses found in beer in such comparative analy-ses should also be done, because GNB as a whole are generally resistant to the effect of hops, while Gram-positive bacteria are generally sensitive. As the anaerobic brewing-related GNB possess fea-tures of Gram-positive bacteria, and beer spoilage Gram-positive bacteria have genetic mechanisms frequently acquired by horizontal gene transfer, for handling hop compounds, an important question is: what genes are specifically expressed in brewing-related GNB to counteract the antimicrobial effects of hops? The data obtained in this regard again will have relevance to our understanding of both bacte-rial evolution and bacterial adaptation to the beer environment.

Metagenomics and biofilms
Increasingly,  metagenomic  analysis  of  samples taken from a wide range of environments is filling in the large gaps in our knowledge of bacteria vis à vis where they are and what activities they are perform-ing. Here, by way of example, it is worth repeating the findings of P. cerevisiiphilus in mangrove sedi-ments in Thailand and Propionispira in a plant root sample collected in Kyrgyzstan. These metagenom-ics outcomes point to plant material or related soil being the source for these bacteria finding their way into breweries. As metagenomic analyses from a wide range of studies become deposited in public data bases, routine surveying of the information is

likely to provide additional insights on the environ-mental sources for each of the nine brewing-related anaerobic GNB, as well as their close taxonomic rel-atives. Paying attention to sources and locations of bacteria that are closely related to the nine currently known  brewing-related  anaerobic  GNB  species could prove interesting in terms of understanding or even anticipating the emergence of yet other brewing-related GNB that have a high probability of belonging to the Firmicutes phylum.
Metagenomic analyses should also be under-taken using samples taken from materials coming into breweries and the brewing process, as well as using samples collected widely within brewer-ies. Such analyses done in a systematic fashion on a periodic basis will provide not only baseline data for all bacteria moving into and establishing themselves with a brewery, but also for how differ-ent spoilage bacteria are able to relocate over time within a brewery. The metagenomics approach to sampling of biofilms within breweries is particularly relevant as we still do not clearly understand how both aerobic and anaerobic GNB establish and maintain themselves within a brewery. Provided the analysis is done such that eukaryotes (brewing and wild yeast) are also tested for along with all forms of bacteria, information should be forthcoming that clarifies exactly how GNB, particularly those that are anaerobes, are able to persist in a brewery. Such data collected over time will provide a better picture of what microbes co-exist within the same brewery locations. Moreover, this approach is the most detailed way to document whether brewery hygiene procedures are working or not and, if not, where remedial action in brewery operations are required.
Along  with  routine  and  systematic  brewery biofilm assessment, experimental modelling of bio-films should be done, incorporating all the different types of microbes found in the brewery environ-ment. The basis for this is the under-appreciated fact that brewing-related lactobacilli and pedio-cocci, and aerobic or anaerobic GNB do not grow in isolation. There is an inherent need to determine how each microbial member found within a biofilm affects other members in the same location and how the microbial composition of biofilms evolves. As one example, using a quantitative PCR approach (e.g. droplet digital PCR), it should be possible to  ascertain  the  relative  quantities  of  different


microbes within biofilms over time, with these data informing how best to inhibit biofilm development as well as decontaminate existing biofilms in the brewery setting.
Omics  methodologies  are  continually  being refined  and  increasingly  cheaper  to  implement. As  discussed  in  the  preceding  chapter,  these experimental tools are already being applied to the Gram-positive LAB beer spoilers, driven in part because LAB are important in many food industries in addition to the brewing industry. In contrast, the brewing-related anaerobic GNB have no useful counterparts in other food or beverage industries; hence, the interest in these bacteria is essentially restricted to brewers, thus accounting for the type and limited amount of research done on these bacteria. Nonetheless, given the unusual features of these anaerobic GNB and given their ability to successfully invade and survive in the beer environment, detailed omics-based studies of these bacteria are certainly warranted.

Abstract
Beer-spoiling yeasts comprise a diverse group of organisms that can have a variety of impacts on beer production. Invariably, contamination of wort or beer by these yeasts leads to inconsistencies within the process, and quality defects in packaged beer. Beer-spoiling yeasts can be broadly separated into non-fermentative (aerobic) and fermentative yeasts. The former typically exploit process steps associated with raw materials, and areas where oxygen  ingress  is  dificult  to  prevent,  such  as unpasteurized cask beers or dispense. Fermentative yeasts are arguably more problematic due to their capacity to compete with production strains during fermentation. Major impacts include altered sugar utilization, flocculation and ethanol production, as well as the formation of phenolic compounds, acid-ity, estery off-flavours, and haze or turbidity. These effects occur primarily due to differences in the genetic, metabolic and physiological characteristics of the spoilage yeast and the production strain. In this chapter, we describe the characteristics and functionality  of  beer-spoiling  yeasts,  as  well  as methods for their isolation and identification.


Introduction
Yeasts are a group of organisms comprising unicel-lular fungi that are capable of dividing asexually by budding or fission, or sexually by the process of sporulation. Industrial or ‘domesticated’ yeasts typically belong to the Saccharomyces genus, and

within the brewing industry two main species are encountered: S. pastorianus and S. cerevisiae (see Chapter 4). These organisms divide asexually and tend not to sporulate, due to their complex genetic make-up  and  unconventional  ploidy.  However, other yeasts can be found within brewing processes that fit the description above more completely. Such species are typically referred to as ‘beer-spoiling’ or ‘wild’ yeasts. Beer-spoiling yeasts are those that have a negative impact on the sensorial qualities of the final product, either by affecting process stages or by changing the character of the beer directly. Within the brewing industry, this definition often incorporates ‘wild yeast’, which is a generic term used historically to define any type of yeast not deliberately introduced into the brewery environment. It should be noted that, at the present time, and within certain sectors of the industry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of strains that do not belong to the traditional brewing yeast Saccharomyces genus (see Chapter 7). This is primarily due to the novel char-acteristics  that  non-Saccharomyces  yeasts  impart to the final product and has resulted in the phrase ‘wild yeast’ (isolated from ‘the wild’) taking on a slightly alternative meaning. Within this Chapter we use the term ‘beer-spoiling yeast’ to indicate unwanted organisms present within the brewing process or beer.
Beer-spoiling yeasts constitute a broad group of   organisms   that,   although   phylogenetically diverse, inevitably comprise individuals that share

key physiological properties, which allow them to exploit sections of the brewing chain. Although most beer-spoiling yeast are isolated either directly or indirectly from areas of the brewery associated with fermentation, others may be found as contam-inants of raw materials through to final pack (Table 11.1). Irrespective of their preferred environment, for simplicity beer-spoiling yeast are often char-acterized as Saccharomyces or non-Saccharomyces types. Of these, the Saccharomyces spoilage yeasts are often regarded as being the most hazardous since they are dificult to detect, and compete directly with the culture strain. However, there is also a range of non-Saccharomyces species that are associated with beer spoilage and these include members of the genera Brettanomyces, Candida, Debaryomyces, Hanseniaspora(Kloeckera), Kluyvero-myces, Pichia, Torulaspora, and Zygosaccharomyces. There are inevitably incidences of contamination with other types of yeast, but species and strains belonging to these genera tend to predominate.


Taxonomy of beer-spoiling yeast species
As described by Sampaio et al. (see Chapter 4) and below (see ‘Molecular methods for identification of beer-spoiling yeast species’), yeast species are increasingly classified according to DNA sequence homology. However, fungi were historically organ-ized  and  named  based  primarily  on  structures associated  with  sexual  reproduction  (i.e.  spore morphology), along with physiological character-istics, including cell size and shape, and nutritional requirements.  While  much  of  this  information remains useful today, it has inevitably led to confu-sion in naming and identifying species, since the

predominant mode of replication for many yeasts associated with industrial processes is asexual (i.e. non-spore forming). Furthermore, those species that do undergo sexual reproduction only do so under certain conditions and only one method of reproduction is typically observed at a specific point in time. Hence, in practice, many fungi have multiple names based on their sexual state when they were first isolated, a phenomenon particularly relevant to beer-spoiling yeasts. For example the genus names Brettanomyces and Dekkera refer to the same organism; Brettanomyces refers to the asexual (anamorph) form, while Dekkera is the name used to describe the sexual form (teleomorph). Current consensus within the world of yeast taxonomy is that fungal species should be referred to by a single name and that teleomorphic names cannot have pri-ority over anamorphic ones (McNeill et al., 2012; Gams, 2016). However, it is also acknowledged that the designated genus name will often be guided by common usage. Hence, within the brewing indus-try it is still acceptable (if not desirable) that certain nomenclatures will continue to be used. It is antici-pated that this rule should lead to greater clarity in the future. Previously there has been a degree of confusion within the brewing industry, especially with regard to spoilage yeasts that were originally classified as separate species, or those that have undergone a number of re-classifications. To illus-trate this point, Pichia anomola (previously known as Hansenula anomola) is a teleomorph of Candida peliculosa; each form has different characteristics and exerts potentially different impacts on the prod-uct and process. Other yeasts have been described as having a ‘tortuous history’ due to nomenclature confusion caused by repeated reclassification. One particular example is the yeast Candida utilis, a

The physiology of beer-spoiling yeast

Vegetative growth, cell structure and sexual division
When a yeast culture encounters favourable con-ditions, it is advantageous for the population to divide vegetatively, or asexually. This allows new individuals to be generated quickly through mito-sis, producing cells that are theoretically identical barring random mutation events. The majority of yeasts found within brewery locations reproduce predominantly  via  this  mode  of  replication.  In most instances, vegetative growth occurs through budding,  whereby  a  new  cell  is  produced  via localized expansion and extrusion of the mother cell wall. The precise mechanism can vary, with different yeasts employing multilateral or bipolar divisional patterns. It should be noted that other types  of  yeasts  (including  those  not  typically found in breweries) may divide vegetatively via a number of mechanisms, including binary fission (notably Schizosaccharomyces pombe), bud fission, and via stalks or outgrowths. In addition to asexual reproduction, some beer-spoiling yeasts have the ability to reproduce sexually via karyogamy (fusion of cells to form a zygote) and subsequently meio-sis. These events result in the formation of spores contained within an ascus (essentially a sac derived from the original fusion of the two parental cells). Sexual reproduction is relatively common in many beer-spoiling yeasts and can be induced by sudden changes in environmental conditions or nutrient deficiency (starvation).
All yeasts exhibit characteristic cellular struc-tures: a rigid outer wall and a fluid cell membrane envelope the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles, and a variety of vesicles and microbodies. However, despite being virtually identical in terms of cellular

constituents, yeasts as a group of organisms are morphologically diverse. A culture of brewing yeast typically comprises a population of uniform cells that are spherical or slightly ellipsoidal in shape, and between 6 and 10µm in diameter (Fig. 11.1). In contrast, beer-spoiling yeast (as well as other non-domesticated species isolated from the wild) can show a wide variety of cell shapes and sizes (Fig.  11.2).  Broadly  speaking,  vegetative  cells belonging to different yeast species can be described as being spherical, ellipsoidal, ovoid (egg-shaped), apiculate (lemon-shaped), pointed, rectangle-like, bottle (or flask)-shaped, or elongated. Yeast cell morphology is influenced by a number of factors, often linked closely to budding or budding pat-terns. In general, cells that are oval usually exhibit either an axial (bud production occurs adjacent to previous site of division) or a bipolar (cells bud at either polar end of the cell) budding pattern, while cells that are elongated tend to produce buds in an almost exclusively bipolar fashion (Chant and Pringle, 1995). This relationship is true for most strains  belonging  to  the  species  Hanseniaspora (Kloeckera), for example, which produce lemon-shaped cells and display a polar divisional pattern. In contract to brewing yeast strains, which show a high degree of morphological homogeneity, non-domesticated  yeasts  can  be  polymorphic;  cells within a population are often visually diverse such that they may at first appear to belong to different species. For example, Brettanomyces populations often  comprise  individuals  that  are  ellipsoidal, elongated,  or  even  rectangular.  Similarly,  some Hanseniaspora species can show extensive poly-morphisms with notable variations in size as well as shape. Differences in morphology within popula-tions are further exacerbated by the pleomorphic nature of yeasts (Fig. 11.3). As described above, under certain conditions yeasts have the ability to form mating aggregates, which lead to the produc-tion of sexual spores. Much of our understanding of the process comes from analysis of Saccharomyces strains, where mating is triggered by specific phero-mones that bind to receptor sites in two opposite ‘mating types’. In S. cerevisiae, these are known as ‘a’ and ‘α’, while in Sch. pombe they are referred to as h+ and h– In other types of yeasts, these nomenclature may be used, although often they are referred to as simply plus (P) or minus (M). In many yeast spe-cies, cells may also switch mating types, allowing

Note that the phenolic (A) and diastatic (B) wild S. cerevisiae strains exhibit a smaller cell size when compared to the lager and ale brewing yeast strains shown in C and D, respectively. Non-brewing strains and some ale-type strains may form chains (A), where individual cells are cytoplasmically discrete, but remain connected due to incomplete separation of mother and daughter at the cell wall.



colonies containing both mating types to develop and ensuring that there are always ‘partners’ availa-ble. Irrespective, the pheromones produced induce mating cells to develop a bottleneck-like projection that extends in the direction of a cell of the opposite mating type. This structure is known as a shmoo and allows for the eventual exchange of genetic material, culminating in spore formation. Typically 1–4 spores are formed within the ascus, the shape of which is highly variable between species. Sac-charomyces yeasts tend to produce spores that are held in a tetrahedral formation, while other species have been described as having ellipsoidal, spherical, elongated, hat-shaped, Saturn-shaped, or kidney-shaped spores (Fig. 11.4). It should be noted that, in contrast to bacterial spores, yeast spores are not particularly  stress  tolerant;  ascospores  are  only slightly more resistant to environmental challenges than vegetative cells.

Many yeast species are also able to adopt a variety of non-sexual structures, including chain formation and pseudohyphal (filamentous) growth. Although budding yeasts do not undergo true hyphal growth, they can exhibit a phenomenon in which cells fully separate by cytokinesis during division, but remain attached to each other due to the presence of specific proteins located in the cell wall. This is termed pseudohyphal growth and is closely linked to nutritional limitation, especially nitrogen defi-ciency (Gimeno et al., 1992; Kron et al., 1994). The majority of information on how this occurs is based on studies of S. cerevisiae, Sch. pombe, and Candida strains. In S. cerevisiae, it is known that immediately prior to the initiation of filamentous growth, a protein known as Ras2p (localized within the cell membrane) is activated, which in turn stimulates the synthesis of cAMP, an intracellular signalling molecule. This results in the activation

It should be noted that these images serve as examples and are not representative of all strains within each species. There is considerable variation within species and often individual strains will show several different morphological types, as seen in Pichia anomola (E). This can be compounded by the presence of sexual spores, formation of mating aggregates (shmoos), and the formation of pseudohyphae (F). For the latter, staining was conducted using calcofluor white to reveal the location of chitin deposits within the cell wall, clearing indicating two discrete cells.

Figure 11.3 Forms of yeast growth. Yeast typically divide asexually to produce discrete cells, but failure to separate through budding can lead to chain formation. Cells can also undergo filamentous (pseudohyphal) growth, form biofilms through mat formation, and undergo ‘shmoo’ formation as a means of exchanging DNA during sexual division, which culminates in spore formation.















Figure  11.4 Spore  formation  in  yeasts  as  observed  under  a  light  microscope  at  approximately  ×400 magnification. Spore morphology is highly variable and dependent on genus and species. Typically between 1 and 4 globose spores will be formed, enclosed within an ellipsoidal ascus (A and B). Saccharomyces spores can be tetrahedral shaped (C) due to the tight rigidity of the ascus, although some may contain just 2 or 3 spores. Some yeasts such as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe form linear asci (D). Pichia species are diverse, showing elongated asci (E), as well as producing spores that can be ‘hat-shaped’ (helmet-shaped) (F) or Saturn-shaped (G). The latter can also be observed in Lindnera saturnus, the genus originally designated for yeast forming such spores, while Hanseniaspora (Kloeckera) and Dekkera (Brettanomyces) form hat-shaped spores. In Zygosaccharomyces cells, a conjugation tube links mating cells together, forming a characteristic dumbbell-shaped zygote (H), while Kluyveromyces marxianus forms kidney- or bean-shaped spores (I). It is common for some species, such as Debaryomyces, to produce lipid bodies as a component of the spore (J), which can be clearly seen under a light microscope. Finally, it should be noted that ascospores can be smooth, warty, or ridged, although this level of detail is not always obvious without the use of a high-powered microscope.

cells are usually elongated (sometimes 20–50µm in length) or ellipsoidal and have constrictions at the septal junctions that connect adjacent cells (Fig. 11.2F). In some instances, complex aggregates of filamentous cells may be observed, including indi-viduals in the process of developing pseudohyphae, which show a variety of intermediate morpholo-gies. The formation of such structures is important from a beer spoilage perspective since elongated or pseudohyphal cells are often those that are able to form a pellicle and float on the surface of liquid media.
Pseudohyphae  should  not  be  confused  with chain formation (Brown, 1970), which occurs in many yeasts, including some ale strains. In both instances,  individual  cells  are  cytoplasmically discrete, but remain connected due to incomplete separation of mother and daughter at the cell wall. However, in chain formation this typically occurs due to a deficiency in CTS1 activity, which codes for chitinase (Kuranda and Robbins, 1991), respon-sible for digesting chitin scar tissue and allowing separation of a daughter cell from its mother. The impact of chain formation can be similar to pseu-dohyphae in that large clumps of cells can form; however, the significance is arguably of greater impact during fermentation, since chains can act as nucleation points for floc formation, resulting in changes to the flocculation properties of the culture yeast.
Some  yeast  species  will  also  undergo  mat formation in response to nutrient limitation, char-acterized by an increased ability to ‘stick’ to surfaces (Wood et al., 1992; Reynolds et al., 2008). This is also believed to be due to activation of the FLO11 gene, which causes changes in the cell wall that enhance cell–cell adhesion. Interestingly, the mat itself is subject to nutrient and pH gradients, which is believed to impact on the activity of Flo11p rather than gene expression. Cells located at the ‘rim’ of the mat structure show decreased adher-ence properties as a result of higher pH, which may enable the colony to spread more easily (Reynolds, 2008). The ability of cells to stick together in this fashion can be desirable in production yeast strains that are used for bottle conditioning, but can be problematic in beer-spoiling yeasts since this can encourage  the  production  and  development  of biofilms. Biofilms are aggregates of cells of one or more species (including in some circumstances

both  yeasts  and  bacteria  together)  that  adhere to one another and form a community separated from the external environment by the develop-ment of a glycoprotein-polysaccharide layer known as a glycocalyx. This serves to protect organisms located  within  the  biofilm  structure,  with  the result that they will often display enhanced resist-ance  to  removal  through  conventional  cleaning mechanisms. Biofilm formation in Saccharomyces yeast is known to be an intricate process with the activation of at least 71 genes (Andersen et al., 2014), a phenomenon likely to be equally complex in other yeast species. Once formed, the biofilm is a relatively stable unit and will continue to grow in size until it becomes physically too large to remain attached, or is disrupted in some way, leading to a portion of the biofilm breaking away and cells being released. During biofilm formation, certain yeasts can act as primary colonisers, which then provide a mechanism for the attachment and inclusion of other species, which may not have the capacity to stick to surfaces on their own. Within the brewery environment, this can lead to the development of complex and potentially serious biofilms. For example, it has been shown that non-Saccharomyces yeasts such as Pichia anomola can provide an initial surface attachment for the subsequent colonization by Saccharomyces strains, the presence of which then increases the spoilage potential of the biofilm (Timke et al., 2008).

Cell size and colour in beer-spoiling yeasts
While sexual state, cell shape, and the develop-ment of aggregates can often clearly differentiate between a production strain and a contaminant, there are other differences that may also be evident. Although beer-spoiling yeasts can be similar in size to industrial strains, typically they are smaller, with a diameter of 2–6µm. The reason for the difference in size between domesticated and non-domesticated yeasts is unknown, although it may be an artefact of the greater ploidy of industrial strains, which tends to lead to an increase in cell volume (Müller, 1971). There can also be considerable variation in size within a population, which is often immediately evident in yeasts showing an elongated morphol-ogy, or in those strains that produce pseudohyphae. This  intra-population  variability  is  dificult  to rationalize, as cell size is typically related to cell
296 |  Powell and Kerruish


cycle regulation. In particular, there is a require-ment to achieve a critical size prior to passing through ‘Start’ within the cell cycle, a checkpoint that commits the cell to division (Hartwell, 1974; Johnston et al., 1977). This results in haploid cells (and the majority of industrial strains) typically having a similar size dispersion at the point of divi-sion. From a functional perspective this make sense; many cellular functions are dependent on cell size, and changes to cell volume can have a major impact on nutrient uptake, metabolic flux, and the capacity to biosynthesise important cellular compounds. Furthermore, the basic machinery of cell transport and division in eukaryotes relies on the cytoskeletal network, which plays an important role in form-ing and positioning the mitotic spindle (Marshall et al., 2012). Microtubules have a limited range of lengths, and if cell structure and size become changed or abnormal, then the mitotic apparatus may have dificulty working, resulting in a reduced ‘fitness’ within the population. Consequently, the reason for size discrepancy within species, strains, and populations is unknown, although it is possi-ble that a less tightly regulated control mechanism in non-domesticated yeasts may allow for greater functional  plasticity  as  opposed  to  in  brewing strains, where growth conditions are controlled within tightly defined parameters.
The colour of yeast cells belonging to different species may also be variable. Although most types of beer-spoiling yeasts produce colonies that are cream or white (using standard media that does not influence colour directly), other yeasts can be a variety of colours such as pink, orange, or yellow. The reason why there is a divergence in colour is yet to be fully explored, although many organisms (including plants and animals) produce a variety of pigments that can act to absorb light, such as carotenoid compounds. This can serve to benefit the organism in a number of ways, including as a form of protection, as vitamin precursors, or as antioxidants (Mata-Gómez et al., 2014). Although not a beer spoiler, evidence indicates that this is almost certainly the case for the black yeast Hortaea werneckii, in which melanin is the primary cause of the colouration observed (Kejžar et al., 2013). Of the beer-spoiling yeasts, Rhodotorula exhibits a  characteristic  red  colouration  derived  from  a variety of carotenoids (Mrak et al., 1949), although

the precise benefits of this to the cell have yet to be ascertained.


Origins and impacts of beer-spoiling yeasts
The natural environment of yeasts is known to be diverse, with species isolated from a huge range of locations and ecosystems. Interestingly, the natural habitat of S. cerevisiae yeasts (encompassing many industrial, and beer-spoiling strains) has been the subject of much debate, although current consen-sus is that they are primarily associated with the bark and litter of trees, specifically oak (Sampaio and Gonçalves, 2008; see Chapter 4). It is unclear whether oak trees are genuinely the primary habitat for S. cerevisiae yeasts, or whether this association is due to biased sampling; the more we look for this species of yeast, the more we find. Indeed, although the majority of yeasts exist in habitats associated with plant material, detritus, and soils, they can also be found in water (salt and fresh), on animals and insects, and can be dispersed through air. Most beer-spoiling yeasts are likely to originate from these sources and become introduced to the process opportunistically. Unlike certain species of bacteria (e.g. Pediococcus damnosus), spoilage yeasts are typically not unique to industrial locations, but are associated with raw materials such as hops, priming sugars and adjunct syrups, and casks. It is accepted that specific materials are often not the direct cause of contamination but act as a source of entry into the brewery, leading to contamination across different stages of the brewing chain (Table 11.1). Consequently, brewing equipment, surfaces, water supplies, and pitching yeast can also be con-sidered to be potential sources of infection and should attract particular attention from a hygiene perspective, especially if a repeat contamination is observed.
As mentioned above, beer-spoiling yeasts are often described as being Saccharomyces or non-Saccharomyces. This classification is based primarily on the fact that different methods of detection are generally  employed  for  each  group.  However, there are also broad differences in terms of spoil-age potential; the majority of non-Saccharomyces yeasts do not typically compete with production strains during fermentation and cannot establish
Beer-spoiling Yeasts |  297


themselves within the process. This is primarily because many non-Saccharomyces yeasts depend on oxygen for growth, and their influence is there-fore limited due to tight oxygen control within the brewing process. In addition, non-brewing strains are generally ineficient at metabolizing maltose, the predominant sugar associated with wort, and consequently  many  beer-spoiling  yeast  strains are at a competitive disadvantage during brewing fermentations. Spoilage by these yeasts is therefore restricted to raw materials and the early stages of fermentation, where simple sugars and some oxygen may be present. Exceptions to this can be found in breweries that employ open fermentation vessels or foeders (barrel fermentations), where oxygen ingress may act to stimulate growth.
Ethanol tolerance and the ability to grow at low pH are central properties that enable yeasts to spoil fermenting wort and beer, and this is where the most serious impacts can be found. During fermentation, use of an inappropriate production strain or the presence of a killer yeast (see section ‘Beer-spoiling yeasts and killer toxins’) can have particularly negative effects. Typically, spoilage is through the production of inappropriate levels of esters, higher alcohols and vicinal diketone (VDK), which cause flavour imbalance during fermenta-tion. However, certain species of yeasts can also produce  specific  off-flavours  including  organic acids, sulfur-containing compounds, and phenolics. An additional impact is related to the performance of the culture yeast; the majority of beer-spoiling yeast strains do not sediment in the same fashion as production strains, often displaying a weaker flocculation potential (see ‘Beer-spoiling yeasts and flocculation’). Many non-production yeasts also do not interact with finings, since they do not exhibit a strong negative charge. The result of this is to create cloudy beer with associated off-flavour production due to cell lysis.
Packaged beer that has been filtered and pasteur-ized rarely undergoes spoilage by yeasts. Although strains  show  variability  in  heat  tolerance,  their ability to withstand temperatures associated with pasteurization are such that their survival is a rela-tively rare occurrence (Tsang and Ingledew, 1982). When spoilage does occur, this is generally due to carry-over of culture yeast or spoilage yeasts that are smaller and less subject to fining. Some yeasts

can also be an issue in traditional cask-conditioned beers, giving rise to quality defects. Typically, the result of contamination post-fermentation is that residual sugars are utilized and yeasty or phenolic off-flavours are produced. Growth can also result in the formation of haze and sediments and in some instances the development of pellicles or surface films that act to ensure the proximity of yeast to headspace oxygen.


Anaerobic (fermentative) beer-spoiling yeasts
Yeast   contaminants   that   exhibit   fermentative properties  represent  a  serious  problem  within the brewery since they can compete directly with production  strains.  Furthermore,  the  similarity of these yeasts to brewing strains can make them dificult to detect. The characteristics and effects of fermentative beer-spoiling yeasts on the product and process are variable. Yeast species belonging to the genera Kluyveromyces, Saccharomyces, Torulas-pora, and Zygosaccharomyces can show an enhanced growth rate such that they have the capacity to displace the culture yeast over the course of serial re-pitching. Given that a brewing yeast slurry may be used from as few as 3–4 times to as many as >100 serial re-pitchings, it is clear that under cer-tain circumstances this could lead to significant issues. With the exception of strains that exhibit killer activity (see section ‘Beer-spoiling yeasts and killer toxins’), fermentative yeasts do not harm the production strain but may compete for resources, reduce  ethanol  yield,  and  generate  off-flavours. Although major changes to the end product can indicate their presence, often much less apparent and more subtle defects are caused. Fermentative beer-spoiling yeast strains often exhibit differences in sugar preference and patterns of nutrient utiliza-tion that can lead to variations in the concentrations of esters, higher alcohols, and VDK. In addition, many spoilage yeasts do not flocculate well and do not interact with finings, with the result that they can pass into conditioning where they can have negative  sensorial  effects  on  post-fermentation beer, as well as causing haze and turbidity. A sum-mary of the characteristics and spoilage potential of aerobic beer-spoiling yeasts can be found in Table 11.2.

Hanseniaspora (Kloeckera)
Hanseniaspora   (anamorph:   Kloeckera)   species reproduce via bipolar budding, usually resulting in cells that display a characteristic apiculate shape. However, Hanseniaspora can produce a variety of cell morphologies, with pairs of cells being rela-tively common (with a skittle-like appearance), as well as elongated and bottle-shaped individuals. Short pseudohyphae structures can also be formed, leading to surface film formation, although this is

typically not as strong as pellicles formed by other genera. Interestingly, Hanseniaspora species have been reported to be one of the predominant yeast genera found on grapes and can often be found during the early stages of natural wine fermenta-tions (Heard and Fleet, 1985; Prakitchaiwattana et al., 2004). There is some evidence to suggest that due to their association with fruits, certain Hanseniaspora species such as H. uvarum and H. apiculata can be carried by drosophila flies (Miller
Beer-spoiling Yeasts |  299


and Phaff, 1962), hence insect vectors are likely to form a major route into the brewery, as well as raw materials. Within the brewing process, Hansenias-pora spp. are mainly found during the aerobic stages of fermentation and are sometimes associated with draft beer (Wiles, 1950; Hemmons, 1954).

Kluyveromyces
Kluyveromyces cells are generally ovoid or ellipsoi-dal, although other morphologies can be observed, including elongated cells and the production of pseudohyphae. Kluyveromyces strains are homothal-lic and are therefore able to self-fertilize, producing heat-resistant ascospores. Yeast belonging to this genus are industrially significant and can have a positive impact in fermented milk products, natural wine fermentations and traditional African beers (Maoura et al., 2005; Jolly et al., 2014; Misihairab-gwi et al., 2015; Prado et al., 2015). Kluyveromyces species such as K. lactis and K. marxianus (see also section on Candida, below) are also able to ferment a range of sugars that many other yeasts cannot, including lactose, inulin, and the pentose sugar xylose. Hence, these yeasts have been explored for the conversion of waste products (including whey) for bioethanol production. Isolates found within the brewery may be derived from malt and other raw materials. General spoilage effects include the production of turbidity and off-flavours as a result of vigorous fermentation. However, some strains contain killer plasmids (see section ‘Beer-spoiling yeasts and killer toxins’), which can have a severely negative impact on a pitching yeast culture and hence overall fermentation progression (Stark and Boyd, 1986; Rodriguez-Cousino et al., 2011).

Saccharomyces
The Saccharomyces genus is perhaps the most well described of all the yeasts, due to the widespread use of S. cerevisiae for industrial purposes, and the availability of many full genome sequences for anal-ysis. Cells are typically globose or ellipsoidal, and vegetative reproduction is by multilateral budding. Most species are capable of forming pseudohy-phae, although this rarely happens in S. pastorianus (lager) yeasts or in S. cerevisiae (ale) brewing strains. Within the genus, most species are able to replicate sexually, producing characteristic tetraploid asci (Fig. 11.4). However, brewing yeasts belonging to S. cerevisiae or S. pastorianus only do so rarely, due

to their genetic complexity and hybrid status. As beer-spoiling yeasts, Saccharomyces strains can be found in various locations within the brewery, but are predominantly associated with the fermenta-tion stages of the process.
From  a  brewing  perspective,  the  term  ‘Sac-charomyces beer-spoiling yeast’ invariably refers to S. cerevisiae strains. However, most Saccharomyces species are capable of contaminating wort, includ-ing strains belonging to S. bayanus, S. kudriavzevii, and S. mikatae. In general, Saccharomyces yeasts dis-play properties that are relatively similar to brewing strains, and are therefore dificult to detect, while representing a very serious threat to the brewing process. It is also important to reiterate that the definition of beer-spoiling yeast includes produc-tion strains and variants that have not been directly introduced to the process by the brewer. Conse-quently, this can include the accidental mixing of different types of brewing yeasts (ale/lager) or the use of an incorrect strain within either category. The mixing of production strains used for ale- and lager-type products can be especially problematic due to their intrinsic differences in fermentation properties.  This  is  apparent  when  considering their response to fermentation temperature (lager products are generally fermented at colder temper-atures), the typical flavour profiles associated with these two styles of beer (ale strains produce more fruity notes), and their flocculation characteristics (lager strains are traditionally classified as bottom-fermenting,  while  lagers  are  top-fermenting). However, the precise effects of mixing equivalent ‘types’ of production strains are dificult to predict and are largely dependent on strain phenotype. The most likely results include variations in flavour, attenuation rate, flocculation and cropping patterns. However, in reality these may be relatively subtle changes, especially if the level of contamination is low, or if there is a high degree of strain similarity. In the latter instance, differences can sometimes be offset by blending of the product, although this is not desirable or recommended, especially for core brands or premium products.
A similar range of effects can be observed when mutants derived from production strains are used. These can be particularly problematic since they are by nature very dificult to detect, especially if there is a gradual change in the concentration of variants with successive fermentations. Arguably the two
300 |  Powell and Kerruish


most commonly encountered types of mutants are flocculation variants (showing either decreased, or more commonly increased flocculation potential) and respiratory-deficient (RD) mutants with defec-tive  mitochondria.  Changes  to  the  flocculation characteristics of a culture can have consequences with regard to overall production consistency. For example, an unexpectedly early and heavy crop can result in stuck fermentations or can create issues with regard to mechanically removing the yeast crop. If mitochondrial deficient cells, otherwise known as ‘petite’ mutants (due to the production of small colonies on solid agar), are present in signifi-cant numbers, this tends to influence beer flavour production. As petite cells are slow to grow and divide, this can lead to a sluggish fermentation with an inappropriate balance of flavours. For example, the presence of petite cells is widely associated with unacceptable levels of diacetyl.
More conspicuous effects can arise when non-production Saccharomyces strains are encountered. These  often  display  certain  properties  that  are different and/or undesirable to those found in pro-duction yeasts (Jespersen et al., 2000). The most noticeable are those that are capable of producing phenolic off-flavour (POF) compounds (see sec-tion ‘Production of phenolic compounds’) or that have diastatic activity. Most brewing strains are unable to utilize long-chain sugars (dextrins), often claimed to contribute to mouthfeel in beer. Some S. cerevisiae strains (previously classified separately as S. diastaticus) are amylolytic and possess the STA genes, responsible for glucoamylase produc-tion  (Tamaki,  1978;  Adam  et  al.,  2004).  This allows the breakdown of dextrins, leading to super-attenuation of wort and resulting in a beer that has an unusually low final gravity and low residual extract. Diastatic yeasts can have more disastrous consequences when associated with unpasteurized bottled beer. The production of abnormally high concentrations of carbon dioxide can increase the risk of exploding bottles. Furthermore, many dia-static strains are also POF+ and the use of residual dextrins for growth can therefore result in phenolic flavour production, as well as haze formation and other off-flavours.

Schizosaccharomyces
Schizosaccharomyces,   along   with   Saccharomyces species, represent one of the most widely studied

yeast genera. This is partly due to the ease at which cell structure and cell cycle events can be visual-ized; cells are rod-shaped and do not divide by budding, but through lateral fission via cross-wall formation, which causes individuals to take on a ‘v’-like  configuration  during  vegetative  growth. Due to their distinctive budding pattern, Schizos-accharomyces yeasts look considerably different to other yeasts encountered within the brewery. Cells are typically uniform and although pseudohyphae may be present, pellicles are not generally formed. Similar to Saccharomyces yeasts, Schizosaccharomy-ces are primarily heterothallic (although mating type switching can occur), producing linear or dumbbell-shaped asci. By far the most common species,  Sch.  pombe,  is  employed  in  traditional African beers (pombe being the Swahili word for beer), some fermented tea products, and can be found naturally associated with soil and plants including barley. Sch. pombe is a Crabtree-positive yeast (see section 'Sugar uptake and metabolism of beer-spoiling yeasts') capable of fermentation and shows osmophilic properties and resistance to some chemical preservatives. Although it is not a widely reported beer-spoiling yeast, the presence of this organism can lead to off-flavour production and inconsistent fermentations.

Torulaspora
Torulaspora cells are spherical and homogeneous in structure, with less intra-population variation than seen with some other yeast genera. Cells are haploid during vegetative growth, but due to their homothallic  nature,  mating  can  occur  between the nuclei of a mother and daughter cell. The resulting spores are formed in the husk of the two cellular structures, which remain closely attached, although sometimes a small conjugation tube may be observed. Genetically, Torulaspora species are closely related to Zygosaccharomyces and Saccha-romyces; however, they are physiologically distinct and are particularly well adapted to tolerate osmoti-cally  challenging  environments.  Consequently, species such as T. delbrueckii can often be found in habitats that are associated with high sugar concen-trations, including food products such as molasses, honey  and,  importantly,  sugar-based  syrups  or adjuncts. This genus of yeast is capable of good growth under anaerobic conditions and is suited to conditions associated with fermentation, as well
Beer-spoiling Yeasts |  301


as contamination of raw materials such as priming sugars. The main impact of this organism is to cause turbidity and off-flavour production.

Zygosaccharomyces
Zygosaccharomyces yeasts form round or ellipsoidal cells and sporulate rarely, producing characteristic dumbbell-shaped asci due to spores being located in each of the two parental cell structures. Pseudo-hyphae may be formed, though these are typically short and do not lead to robust pellicle formation. Zygosaccharomyces species are arguably one of the most important spoilage yeasts within the food industry in general, with the potential to contami-nate a wide range of food products. This is primarily because  they  are  resistant  to  many  traditional means of preserving foods, exemplified by their ability to withstand desiccation and resist high levels of ethanol and low pH (including tolerance to weak acids, such as acetic) (Stratford et al., 2013). In  addition,  they  are  particularly  osmotolerant (Dakal et al., 2014) and can thrive under high sugar concentrations, potentially contaminating syrups and adjuncts. There are several species that can be found in brewery locations, the most common being Z. bailii and Z. rouxii. These organisms can cause issues with beer clarity and flavour as they fer-ment strongly, producing a range of higher alcohols as well as typical yeasty off-flavours.


Aerobic (non-fermentative) beer-spoiling yeasts
The use of the phrase ‘non-fermentative’ is slightly misleading, as many species of yeast within this category can ferment (albeit weakly) under certain conditions. However, others are unable to ferment complex sugars or only show limited replication capacity under anaerobic conditions; the fact that these  yeasts  require  oxygen  for  robust  growth suggests that the term ‘aerobic’ may be a more appropriate descriptor. Aerobic yeasts are more likely to be found within areas of the brewery that are not associated with the fermentation step, for example raw materials, surfaces and equipment, and in final pack. However, it is important to note that even aerobic species are often able to survive at low concentrations during fermentations and persist through serial re-pitching. Generally their pres-ence during the fermentation stage is unlikely to

significantly affect the final product since they will most likely remain below a threshold cell number or be out-competed by the production strain. Of the aerobic beer-spoiling yeasts, Pichia and Candida species are arguably the most important since they are relatively prevalent (Jespersen and Jakobsen, 1996); however, Kluyveromyces, Torulaspora and Brettanomyces can also act as opportunistic spoil-ers  during  the  process,  particularly  during  the aerobic phase of fermentation and in situations where oxygen ingress is dificult to prevent, such as in unpasteurized cask beers. A summary of the characteristics and spoilage potential of aerobic beer-spoiling yeast can be found in Table 11.3.

Brettanomyces (Dekkera)
Of  the  non-Saccharomyces  beer-spoiling  yeasts, Brettanomyces  spp.  have  arguably  the  greatest potential impact on beer and have been the subject of detailed scientific investigation. This is partly because they are desirable for the production of certain beer types, including lambic, guez, and some saison-style products, but also because they are considered to be amongst the most dangerous spoilage microbes in alcoholic beverages, particu-larly  in  wine  production  (Schifferdecker  et  al., 2014). Brettanomyces cells are typically sausage- or bullet-shaped,  but  overall  morphology  can  be variable. They are able to produce pseudohyphae and can sporulate; as mentioned previously (see section ‘Taxonomy of beer-spoiling yeast species’), the sexual forms of Brettanomyces were historically classified  as  belonging  to  the  species  Dekkera. Reclassification of many yeasts within the genus has resulted in five species: B. bruxellensis, B. anomalus, B. custerianus, B. naardenensis, and B. nanus. All of these have been isolated from beers, but arguably the first two are the most frequently reported. In the wild, Brettanomyces yeasts are associated with trees and the surfaces of fruit; it is thought that Bret-tanomyces strains may be introduced to breweries by insect vectors such as fruit flies (Christiaens et al., 2014).
Yeasts  belonging  to  this  species  are  often described as ‘survivalists’ since they are ethanol tolerant and resistant to low pH which means that they are well adapted to withstand the fermenta-tion process (Steensels et al., 2012). As well as being recognized contaminants of beer and wine, they can also cause issues in the manufacture of

soft beverages and dairy products. Although Bret-tanomyces yeasts are facultative anaerobes, due to the Custers effect (see section, ‘The Custers effect’, below) they readily convert sugar into ethanol and acetic acid in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, they are able to degrade and ferment complex sugars (dextrins) that are not readily utilized by the culture yeast. Consequently, they pose a significant threat to unpasteurized beers in which oxygen ingress may occur and spoilage of beer is characterized by the for-mation of particularly high concentrations of acetic

acid. In addition, these yeasts exhibit an enhanced capacity for biomass generation, causing turbidity, while in the case of extreme infections a surface film may also be visible. Brettanomyces are also responsible for the production of volatile phenolic compounds (see section, ‘Production of phenolic compounds’, below) such as 4-ethylphenol (often described as barnyard, horsey or medicinal) and 4-ethylguaiacol (bacon, spice, cloves, smoky), and volatile fatty acids such as isovaleric acid (sweaty saddle, cheese, rancid). As can be imagined, many

of these flavours are undesirable in the vast majority of beers produced worldwide. For a comprehensive review of positive characteristics associated with the use of Brettanomyces strains for beverage pro-duction, the reader is directed to Steensels et al., 2015; see also Chapters 4, 6 and 7.

Candida
The Candida genus is often described as being ‘oversized’, since it comprises species with a wide spectrum of characteristics. Diversity within the genus is an artefact of the original classification of yeasts, during which many anamorphic species were placed into this group. Since that time the genus has undergone many changes, with some Candida yeasts being reclassified and others, such as  Torulopsis,  becoming  incorporated.  Despite this, many Candida species remain genetically and phenotypically close to those within other genera. Further ambiguity remains due to the fact that some species are anamorphic forms of other yeasts (including Pichia and some Kluyveromyces species). Candida strains produce vegetative cells that are typically ovoid and small in size. Although they are often associated with human disease, some have a purely commensal relationship with humans and the majority are not pathogenic. Others, such as C. kefyr (Kluyveromyces marxianus), can be used to produce fermented milk products (e.g. kefir), while C. tropicalis is a major spoilage organism with respect to a variety of food types, including beer. Candida species found within the brewery can only grow aerobically and are not a major threat during active  fermentation.  However,  they  may  cause issues during the initial stages of the fermentation process and, since cells are typically small in size, they may ultimately be slow to sediment and cause haze and filtration issues. Candida species can also oxidize ethanol to produce acetic acid in the pres-ence of air, which can be particularly problematic in
the draft beer trade.

Debaryomyces
Debaryomyces yeasts are spheroidal to ellipsoidal and  reproduce  vegetatively  by  lateral  budding. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two cells, typically mother and daughter, and often via a  short  conjugation  tube.  Debaryomyces  species are  weakly  fermentative  organisms  that  exhibit poor growth in the absence of oxygen. However,

D. hansenii is one of the most prevalent foodborne yeasts since it is tolerant to a variety of stresses including  those  associated  with  cold,  salt,  and changes in osmolality. Due to these characteristics, it is a common organism related to the production of surface-ripened cheeses and varieties of dried sausage. Within the brewing chain, this species can be found associated with raw materials, particularly malt. In addition, it is able to form a film on the surface of liquids due to hydrophobic cell wall components that cause cells to congregate at the liquid–gas interface, as well as having the potential to produce acetic acid and esters when associated directly with wort or beer.

Pichia
This genus is a large and diverse group of yeasts that represent one of the more common non-fermenta-tive spoilage organisms found within the brewery. The genus has grown due to gene sequence analysis and now incorporates a number of species previ-ously classified elsewhere, including all Issatchenkia species (Kurtzman et al., 2008) and some Candida species. Pichia yeasts tend to reproduce via lateral budding, although pseudohyphal formation and sexual  reproduction  is  relatively  common.  The spores produced are highly variable depending on the species and can be round, hat-shaped, Saturn-shaped, or elongated. Pichia spp. survive best under aerobic conditions and cells are typically found associated with draft beer, raw materials, or the early stages of fermentation. Although they are able to grow anaerobically, they can only ferment glucose, and cell function is impaired by alcohol and low pH. However, they are capable of surviving through fermentation and can represent a recurring issue within the brewery. Pichia species typically produce turbidity and can form films or pellicles on the surface of liquid media. In doing so, Pichia strains increase their opportunity to utilize oxygen that may be present in the head space above the beer. Generally, Pichia yeast also produce a range of estery off-flavours, particularly ethyl acetate, as well as yeasty notes, and are capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetic acid. There is a range of species that can be encountered, typically more than one of which may be present at a given time. This includes P. mem-branifaciens, P. anomola, and P. fermentans, although others such as P. guilliermondii and P. kudriavzevii (previously C. krusei) have also been reported.

Lindnera (previously Williopsis)
Lindnera species are ellipsoidal yeasts that grow primarily   under   aerobic   conditions,   although they may show limited fermentation giving rise to ester production. Yields are extremely high, such that Lindnera species have been explored for the manufacture of isoamyl acetate as a natural flavour-ing compound (Yilmaztekin et al., 2008), and for the production of low alcohol but intensely fruity wines (Erten and Campbell, 2001). Lindnera yeasts are primarily associated with soil, and the most pre-dominant species encountered in a brewing context is L. saturnus (previously W. saturnus), which has been isolated from early fermentation. This species produces characteristic Saturn-shaped spores, and is also closely associated with killer yeast activity (see ‘Beer-spoiling yeasts and killer toxins’, below). It should be noted that the species Williopsis califor-nica, which has previously been isolated from barley in the field and during the germination stages of malting (Laitila et al., 2006), is currently classified as Barnettozyma californica (Kurtzman et al., 2008).

Other yeast contaminants
There are inevitably yeast species that have been found within breweries that have not been men-tioned  within  this  chapter.  Furthermore,  there may be species of which we are not yet aware, or incidences where current yeasts have been misi-dentified. Furthermore, there are also some types of yeast that can be considered to be ‘non spoilers’ in the sense that they do not significantly contrib-ute to off-flavour production, aromas, or turbidity. Unless conditions are grossly atypical, these species are unable to survive in hopped wort or spoil beer; however, their presence indicates a poor level of hygiene at some point within the brewery chain. In such instances, it is important to treat contamina-tion with the same degree of gravity as with other more ‘harmful’ yeast or bacterial species. Yeasts that fall under this category include members of the genera Cryptococcus and Rhodotorula, both of which are basidiomycete yeasts.
Rhodotorula  species  are  non-fermenters,  but are  capable  of  thriving  under  cold  conditions and  in  aerobic  environments.  Colonies  form  a characteristic orange, pink, or red colour on solid media. Rhodotorula is found as a contaminant of fish, poultry, and dairy products, but is relatively rare in brewing environments. Although several


studies have shown that Rhodotorula species may be recovered from surfaces and air samples around the brewery, this species is primarily associated with contamination of water and with raw materials. Malt may be a route of entry into the brewery since Rhodotorula yeasts are frequently found on both barley and in finished malt (Flannigan, 1974). They have been isolated from cask conditioned beers and from pitching yeast samples (Brady, 1958) and cause minor sensorial effects.
Cryptococcus species produce a characteristically thick polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the cell. As a group of organisms, they are primarily associated with soil and guano, and some species are serious human pathogens. Cryptococcus spp. have been detected in wheat and barley, and also during the malting process. Although these organ-isms are not normally associated with fermentation, C. difluens has been found in a variety of brewery locations including pipework and surfaces, while C. albidus has been isolated from German wines and  traditional  African  beer  fermentations.  In such instances, they pose minimal threat to human health and do not have a serious impact on the sen-sorial quality of beer or production eficiency.


Genomics and metabolomics of beer-spoiling yeast
The haploid S. cerevisiae strain S288C was the first eukaryotic organism to be fully sequenced in 1996 (Goffeau et al., 1996). Since this time, develop-ments to next-generation sequencing have enabled the process to be undertaken cheaply and much more rapidly. Consequently, the genomes of over 40 different yeast species, including many capable of beer spoilage, have been published (Dujon, 2010). The vast majority of functional genomic studies in yeasts have focused on S. cerevisiae, largely due to the industrial applications of this species. However, with an increasing number of alternative sequences available for a variety of type strains and industrially significant yeasts, it is anticipated that the field of comparative genomics will develop significantly in the near future.
Currently,  analysis  has  focused  on  the  Sac-charomycetales  yeasts,  which  include  industrial strains and the majority of beer-spoiling species, including B. bruxellensis, C. tropicalis, D. hansenii, K. lactis, K. marxianus, P. guilliermondii, Sch. pombe

and Z. Rouxii. All of these organisms are relatively closely related (Fig. 11.5) and have genomes that range in size from 9 to 20 Mb (for haploids) and contain ≈4700–6500 protein-coding genes located on  between  4  and  16  chromosomes  (Dujon, 2010). Chromosome number is highly variable between species and sometimes between strains, while there is also strong evidence to suggest that heterospecific  hybridization  between  yeasts  is relatively common. Interestingly, all of the yeast genomes  analysed  to  date  appear  to  contain  a large number of paralogous gene copies, i.e. genes with shared ancestry due to duplication events. In beer-spoiling organisms, this may either impact on how ‘robust’ strains are, since gene duplications

offer a degree of genetic and evolutionary plastic-ity (Gu et al., 2003), or expand functionality due to  overlapping  metabolic  roles  (Kuepfer  et  al., 2005). Analysis of gene variation between species indicates that there is a trend towards expansion of tandem gene arrays. This is significant from a beer-spoiling perspective since genes known to impact on flocculation contain highly repeated sequences that influence the ‘strength’ of flocculation (Ver-strepen et al., 2005). Similarly, repeat elements are associated with the CUP1 gene (Zhao et al., 2014), which dictates copper resistance, one of the major means of differentiating between culture yeast and non-Saccharomyces strains (see section ‘Detection and identification’, below). Finally, there is also

Branch lengths are not indicative of evolutionary distance. Note that although Brettanomyces is often described as being a member of the Pichiaceae family, this assignment is uncertain. According to certain measures of analysis, Brettanomyces and other Pichiaceae yeasts are only distantly related (Kurtzman and Boekhout, 2011), hence it is placed separately here.

evidence of horizontal gene transfer from bacte-rial species in certain yeasts and the presence of autonomous plasmids or viral elements that could have a significant impact on both the functionality and the threat to industrial fermentation systems (Keeling and Palmer, 2008; Coelho et al., 2013; Lacroix and Citovsky, 2016). When comparing the genomic impact of production brewing strains and beer-spoiling yeasts directly, there are also some more obvious differences that have a major influence on spoilage potential. These are related to flavour development, flocculation, killer activity, and general metabolic activity as described below.

Production of phenolic compounds
One  of  the  major  spoilage  characteristics  of Saccharomyces beer-spoiling yeasts and some non-Saccharomyces species (including Brettanomyces), is the production of phenolic compounds during fermentation. Although these represent desirable flavour attributes in many wheat beers, in the major-ity of instances the presence of these compounds signifies a serious quality defect. In Saccharomyces yeasts, the production of phenolic compounds is largely influenced by the PAD1 gene (often referred to as the phenolic-off-flavour or POF1 gene) which encodes  for  phenylacrylic  acid  decarboxylase (Clausen et al., 1994), while in Brettanomyces a similar function is performed by dbPAD (Godoy et al., 2014). This essentially regulates the decar-boxylation of hydroxycinnamic acids such as ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and cinnamic acid to create 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG), 4-vinylphenol (4-VP), and styrene, respectively (Schwarz et al., 2012). These impart characteristic phenolic (4-VG), clove-like (4-VP), and plastic aromas (styrene) to the beer. At the cellular level, the role of these enzymes is not fully understood. However, it is interesting that they may function to detoxify the cell, since overex-pression of PAD1 in S. cerevisiae results in enhanced growth rate and ethanol productivity in the pres-ence of the hydroxycinnamic acids (Larsson et al., 2001). In Brettanomyces species, vinylphenol reductase (VPR) further converts 4-VG and 4-VP to 4-ethylguaiacol and 4-ethylphenol (Heresztyn, 1986), which impart the smoky, leathery, medici-nal, and clove like flavours often summarized as being ‘barnyard’ or simply ‘Brett’ characteristics. It has been argued that the physiological impact of VPR is to contribute towards redox balance within

the cell, since NADH is used as a cofactor in the reduction of 4-VG and 4-VP to their ethyl deriva-tives. This hypothesis is supported by observations that VPR activity is enhanced under oxygen-limited conditions, increasing NAD+ availability (Curtin et al., 2013).

Beer-spoiling yeasts and killer toxins Some beer-spoiling yeast strains are capable of producing proteins (killer factors) that are toxic and are able to kill a wide range of other (sensi-tive) yeasts. Toxin-secreting strains are referred to as killer yeasts and their presence within the brewery can have devastating effects. Typically, a killer yeast will rapidly replace the production strain and become the dominant organism in the fermentation (Young, 1987). Although killer yeasts are not particularly frequent contaminants within the brewing industry, killer activity is surprisingly common across many yeast species. A survey of 148 species comprising 964 strains from the NCYC collection indicated that 59 produced killer factors, the majority of which were Saccharomyces strains (Philliskirk  and  Young,  1975).  However,  killer activity can also be observed in other species and genera, including Barnettozyma californica, Hanse-niaspora uvarum, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia spp., and Zygosaccharomyces bailii.
The killer phenotype is caused by several dif-ferent mechanisms. In Saccharomyces strains and some other species including Z. bailii, it is believed to arise due to cytoplasmic infection by a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, while in other yeasts (including K. lactis) it is encoded for by a linear dsDNA plasmid, also located in the cytoplasm (Stark et al., 1990). A third variation is seen in yeast species including L. saturnus, P. kluyveri, and H. uvarum, whereby the toxin is encoded chromosom-ally within the nucleus (Kimura et al., 1993; Radler et al., 1985). The best categorized killer strains belong to the first type, the virally induced killer phenotypes. These are caused by an infection with dsRNA viruses belonging to the Totiviridae family, which are widely distributed amongst yeast and higher fungi. In the majority of instances, the virus is  inherited  cytoplasmically,  spreading  horizon-tally during sexual reproduction. In Saccharomyces strains there are at least four major types of killer virus known as ScV-M1, ScV-M2, ScV-M28, and ScV-Mlus.  Each  encodes  a  specific  killer  toxin
Beer-spoiling Yeasts |  307


referred to as K1, K2, K28 and Klus, respectively, as well as a self-protective immunity component (Schmitt and Breinig, 2006; Rodriguez-Cousino et al., 2011). The result of this is that members of each group are able to kill sensitive strains (as well as killer yeasts belonging to any of the other types), but are immune to toxins produced by strains of the same killer type. Other yeasts can give rise to different toxins, for example in Lindnera species four toxins have been observed known as HMK, K500, WmKT, and wicaltin (Theisen et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 1986), while Z. bailii killer yeast can produce an antifungal called zygocin (Radler et al., 1993). There is also considerable variation within species; Saccharomyces yeasts can also pro-duce toxins designated KHR and KHS, which are encoded on the chromosomal DNA. Irrespective of their origin, viral toxins typically kill sensitive cells using one of several different modes of action, the most common of which appear to target either cell membrane function or DNA synthesis. This is certainly the case for K28, which causes inhibition of DNA synthesis, and K1, which causes disruption of the plasma membrane, resulting in the formation of ion channels and thus ion leakage. Other effects include cell cycle arrest in G1 as seen in response to zygocin and inhibition of β-1–3-glucan synthesis, which is associated with the WmKT toxin.

Beer-spoiling yeasts and flocculation One of the major effects of beer-spoiling yeasts on the fermentation process is related to the impact of contamination on the flocculation potential of the culture strain. Flocculation is a form of non-sexual aggregation and can be described as a reversible, calcium-mediated process that is characterized by the adhesion of cells within a population to form aggregates known as flocs (see Chapter 1). These sediment rapidly from the medium in which they are suspended, facilitating beer clarification and providing a cost-effective means of collecting yeast for  re-pitching  into  a  successive  fermentation. Within the brewing industry, it is desirable that this occurs in a regular and predictable fashion, and preferentially towards the end of fermentation once fermentable sugars have been utilized. Conse-quently, the flocculation properties of the culture yeast are of great importance, since they have an impact on the consistency of the process, and the quality of the yeast and the final product.

In Saccharomyces yeasts, flocculation is governed by a group of closely related genes, referred to as the FLO gene family. This family incorporates several groups of genes, the first of which facilitate cell– cell adhesion (FLO1, FLO5, FLO9, and FLO10). FLO8 encodes a transcriptional activator of FLO1 which itself is responsible for the structural protein directly involved in the flocculation process. The remaining gene of interest, FLO11, induces cell-substrate adhesion associated with invasive growth or pseudohyphae formation as described above (see  section,  ‘Vegetative  growth,  cell  structure and sexual division’). The flocculation process is largely driven by lectin-like proteins (flocculins) coded for by the FLO1 gene (Teunissen et al., 1993). These extend out of the cell wall and bind to mannan receptor sites on adjacent cells (Miki et al., 1982; Kobayashi et al., 1998). Less is known about the other genes within the family; although they are structurally similar, the main difference is the degree of flocculation induced by their expres-sion. Genome analysis of non-Saccharomyces yeast species have indicated that they also possess genes that code for cell wall lectins, suggesting that floc-culation may be broadly similar in nature across the  yeasts.  Functional  analysis  of  beer-spoiling yeasts including Debaryomyces (Cubells Martinez et  al.,  1996),  Candida  (Bauer  and  Wendland, 2007), Hanseniaspora (Suzzi et al., 1996), Pichia (Mbawala et al., 1990), Kluyveromyces (El-Behhari et al., 2000), Brettanomyces (Steensels et al., 2015), Torulaspora (Canonico et al., 2016), and Zygosac-charomyces (Suzzi et al., 1992), have indicated that each species demonstrates flocculation phenotypes of varying degrees. However, analysis of the mecha-nism of flocculation in K. marxianus has indicated that the specific structure and spatial arrangement of the cell wall groups involved in flocculation may be species- or genus-specific (Sousa et al., 1992), indicating that the underpinning mechanisms may differ.
Irrespective of the precise mechanism of aggre-gation, at the very basic level brewing strains are highly flocculent compared to most other types of yeast. Hence, it would be expected that the presence of beer-spoiling species would lead to a reduction in flocculation potential, causing issues for post-fermentation processing. However, this is simplistic since flocculation potential in beer-spoiling yeasts is dependent on the species, its physical properties,
308 |  Powell and Kerruish


and the level of contamination. Furthermore, it is known that mixing yeast cultures can give rise to co-flocculation, a phenomenon first described by Eddy (1958), based on observations that non-flocculent strains became flocculent when mixed together. This definition has been extended to describe vari-ations in flocculation observed when two different strains or species are mixed together, irrespective of their individual intrinsic flocculation capacity (Nishihara et al., 2000). Intra- and inter-specific co-flocculation has been reported in Kluyveromyces species (El-Behhari et al., 2000; Sosa et al., 2008), as well as in D. hansenii (previously C. famata) and Sch. pombe (Martinez et al., 1996), and is likely to be a prevalent phenotype across the yeasts. In fact, co-flocculation has also been observed between yeast and beer-spoiling bacteria (Peng et al., 2001), suggesting that such interactions may be impor-tant  in  developing  microbial  ecosystems.  This hypothesis is supported by specific analysis into the genetic regulation of co-flocculation in yeast. It has been reported that individual FLO genes may impact differently on cell–cell adhesion pheno-types, favouring adhesion between some species while excluding others in mixed flocs (Rossouw et al., 2015). This type of interaction was observed betweenHanseniasporastrains and S. cerevisiae wine yeasts, as well as between other species, including P. kudriavzevii. In the same study, FLO gene-specific differences   in   co-flocculation   behaviour   were observed   between   non-Saccharomyces   strains analysed, with FLO1 overexpression consistently leading to increased co-flocculation. Analysis of the remaining FLO genes revealed a complex pattern of results dependent on the combination of strains investigated,  indicating  that  co-flocculation  is  a multifaceted process. However, allowing organisms in co-culture to respond differently to one another may help explain the evolutionary persistence of the FLO gene family, comprising a number of genes that exhibit apparently similar function.

Sugar uptake and metabolism of beer-spoiling yeasts
All yeasts are heterotrophic organisms that require a variety of nutrients in order to be able to pro-duce  energy,  maintain  cellular  function,  grow, and reproduce. A carbohydrate source is essential for the production of ATP, and to fulfil structural carbon requirements, while nitrogen is important

for protein and amino acid synthesis. Phosphorus is required for energy transduction, and as a major component   of   membrane   phospholipids   and nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) synthesis. Metal ions, vitamins, growth factors, and other trace elements may also be required for a variety of structural and functional roles within the cell. The majority of beer-spoiling yeast share broadly the same nutri-tional requirements as production strains; however, there can be significant differences with regard to the preferred sources of individual nutrients and the ways in which they are assimilated and utilized. Many of these differences form the basis of tests for detection of specific groups of yeast (see section ‘Detection and identification’). There are also vari-ations in the extent to which specific metabolic end products are formed; in some species carbon may be directed primarily towards biomass production rather than ethanol. In others, there may be a more diverse range of products, including a higher pro-pensity to form glycerol as a mechanism for redox balance.  Furthermore,  nutritional  requirements may lead to certain metabolic pathways being pref-erentially employed, leading to the production of compounds, such as diacetyl, that are produced as by-products of amino acid metabolism.
The mechanisms of sugar assimilation and break-down form a major difference between brewing and beer-spoiling yeasts. At the basic level, some beer-spoiling yeasts may not be able to transport certain sugars into the cell, while others may eficiently use those that brewing strains cannot, one example being the utilization of the disaccharide lactose by Kluyveromyces. Some yeasts cannot (or prefer not to) undergo fermentation (i.e. non-fermentative yeast strains), while others may only utilize fermen-tation pathways in the presence or absence of certain sugars. Yeasts such as Zygosaccharomyces are highly effective at fermenting simple carbon sources, while some species (especially S. cerevisiae strains with diastatic properties) are able to metabolize complex long-chain sugars. The pattern of sugar assimilation and utilization displayed by individual beer-spoil-ing yeasts can therefore have an impact not only on ethanol yield, but in some instances on mouthfeel, due to the removal of dextrins from beer. The causa-tive reasons for differences in sugar utilization are unknown but are likely to be evolutionarily driven, perhaps related to primary habitat or, in the case of brewing strains, artificial selection. Irrespective,
Beer-spoiling Yeasts |  309


the process of sugar assimilation is controlled both genetically and metabolically, allowing the cell to produce and regulate a series of enzymes involved in uptake and metabolic pathways. In Saccharomy-ces yeasts, glucose uptake principally occurs via facilitated diffusion with no expense of metabolic energy (ATP). However, in other types of yeast the transport mechanism varies; for example, Candida, Kluyveromyces  and  Pichia  strains  employ  active transport as the primary mechanism for glucose uptake. In such systems ATP is required to expel hydrogen ions, which functions to create an elec-trochemical gradient allowing for the transport of sugars into the cell via proton symport. This is an effective method when glucose is in short supply since it allows for transport of sugar against a con-centration gradient, but under optimum conditions the benefit of expending energy for the uptake of sugar is questionable. A potential reason for this

divergence in uptake strategy is that for respiratory (i.e. non-fermentative) yeasts the ‘cost’ is relatively insubstantial given that a theoretical yield of 38 ATP can be achieved from a single glucose molecule through aerobic metabolism. However, for yeasts that rely primarily on the fermentation pathway, yielding 2 ATP per glucose, this is a considerably higher proportion of cellular energy, hence other more cost-effective strategies are preferred (Grifin, 1994).
When yeasts are cultivated on sugar, a flux occurs through central carbon metabolism (Fig. 11.6). As alluded to above, yeasts have the potential to con-vert this sugar into energy through fermentation (glycolysis) or via respiration (Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain). Simplistically, it might be expected that under aerobic conditions yeast would preferentially  utilize  the  respiratory  pathway  to produce ATP, carbon dioxide, and water. Likewise,
























Figure 11.6 Yeast carbohydrate metabolism. Yeasts can employ two major pathways for ATP production from glucose: respiration and fermentation. Glycolysis forms the initial stage of each pathway, which involves the conversion of glucose to pyruvate with the net gain of two units of ATP. During fermentation, pyruvate is subsequently converted into ethanol. This process does not produce additional ATP but is favourable due to the recycling of NAD+, which regenerates the cellular pool of NADH for re-use in glycolysis. During respiration,
pyruvate is oxidized to H2O and CO2  through the process of oxidative phosphorylation. This yields ATP and
regenerates NAD+, but has an absolute requirement for oxygen. Ethanol (and acetic acid in some yeasts) are believed to be formed by yeast as part of a MAC strategy and can be recycled for ATP production if needed. This process yields less energy than the direct oxidation of pyruvate because the synthesis of Acetyl-CoA (through acetaldehyde for ethanol, but directly for acetic acid) requires ATP. Pathways are often employed as a means of redox balance (NAD+/NADH ratio) and are partially regulated by oxygen (Pasteur and Custers effects), and the type and concentration of sugar (Kluyver and Crabtree effects).

under anaerobic conditions it might be expected that the fermentation pathway would be employed with acetaldehyde acting as the final electron accep-tor to produce ATP, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. However, as described above, this is not always the case, with some yeasts preferentially exploit-ing one or other pathway (i.e. being fermentative or non-fermentative). In reality, many yeasts are respiro-fermentative and have evolved to utilize both pathways virtually simultaneously (Hagman and Piskur, 2015). The extent to which this hap-pens is variable and the direction of carbon flux is influenced by a variety of parameters, including the presence/absence of oxygen, the presence/absence of sugars, as well as lesser effects based on the concentrations of inorganic phosphate, glycolytic intermediates, ammonium ions, and intracellular pH. Glucose in particular (although other sugars may be significant, albeit to a lesser extent) and oxygen act as metabolic triggers, causing pathways to be preferentially employed (Rollandet al., 2002). These  regulatory  mechanisms  are  summarized in Table 11.4 and include the Pasteur, Crabtree, Kluyver and Custers effects. With the exception of the Kluyver effect, adoption of these mechanisms is typically driven by the ability to metabolize faster under specific conditions, or as a consequence of  the  generation  of  specific  end-products,  as described below. Both of these strategies are likely to have evolved to provide strains with some form of competitive advantage in ‘natural’ environments.

The Pasteur effect
The  Pasteur  effect  describes  the  phenomenon whereby fermentation is suppressed by the pres-ence of oxygen. In reality, what this means from the perspective of the yeast cell is that the rate of glycolysis is slower under aerobic conditions than anaerobic conditions (due to regulation of phos-phofructokinase within the pathway). This ensures that bottlenecks are not encountered and that all carbon can be metabolized via the Krebs cycle and through oxidative phosphorylation, which is an eficient means of maximizing ATP yield. Argu-ably of equal or greater significance is that this also means that glycolysis proceeds at a faster rate under anaerobic conditions. This is necessitated due to the reduction in ATP yield which is encountered through switching from respiration to fermenta-tion; the cell must increase glycolytic rate to counter this effect and to ensure that ATP demands are met. One caveat for this phenomenon is that the level of glucose must be relatively low (Lagunas, 1979) and that other nutrients (including nitrogen) are also limiting. Interestingly, these criteria are relatively flexible which means that yeasts can differ in their capacity to implement the Pasteur effect. Saccharo-myces yeasts only exhibit the Pasteur effect under quite stringent conditions and when cells are in a ‘resting’ state (i.e. not actively growing). In con-trast, yeasts such as Candida and Pichia are highly susceptible to this effect. The reason why there is such discrepancy is that the Pasteur effect can

be influenced by the presence of other metabolic regulatory phenomena. For example, in some yeast (e.g. brewing strains) the Pasteur effect is rendered insignificant due to the Crabtree effect (see below). Irrespective, increasing the fermentation rate in the absence of oxygen leads to the rapid production of ethanol that can procure a competitive advantage in the ‘natural’ environment. This type of approach is  often  referred  to  as  the  ‘make–accumulate– consume’  (MAC)  strategy,  whereby  organisms produce a compound that accumulates within the environment, and which can be re-assimilated and used for energy production at a later point in time (Fig. 11.6). This strategy may provide a significant benefit to a population since competing organisms, including bacterial species, are typically less toler-ant to ethanol than is yeast.

The Crabtree effect (glucose repression) Arguably one of the most important mechanisms for metabolic regulation in yeast species is the Crabtree effect, often referred to as simply ‘glucose repression’ (Barnett and Entian, 2005). The Crabtree effect occurs irrespective of the presence of oxygen and specifies that if the concentration of sugar is above a certain threshold, cells will metabolize exclusively via fermentation. As the name suggests, this is pri-marily due to repression of the respiratory pathway caused by the presence of glucose, and occurs to the extent that the Pasteur effect is overridden (i.e. the rate of glycolysis is not restricted by oxygen). It should be noted that other sugars such as fructose may also play a similar role to glucose, since many yeasts are able to conduct aerobic fermentation in their presence. However, glucose is certainly the primary sugar involved. The Crabtree effect is observed in most fermentative beer-spoiling yeasts, including Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces and Zygo-saccharomyces. In these organisms, the Crabtree effect can be induced by as little as 0.2% glucose, although this limit can vary upwards. The extent to which the Crabtree effect is induced can also be species-, and to a lesser extent strain-dependent, as indicated by analysis of the ratio of glucose that is fermented/respired under defined conditions (De Deken, 1966; Hagman et al., 2014).
In yeasts, the Crabtree effect can be observed in  the  form  of  a  ‘short-term’  or  ‘long-term’ response. The short-term Crabtree effect occurs when the cell encounters a sudden increase in

glucose  concentration  (Van  Urk  et  al.,  1989), which causes the respiratory pathway to become saturated at pyruvate, resulting in carbon being directed  towards  ethanol  formation  (overflow metabolism) (Fig. 11.6). In contrast, the long-term Crabtree effect, characterized by the response to steady-state conditions, indicates that glucose (or a product of glucose metabolism) actively functions to repress the synthesis of respiratory enzymes. It is known that the yeast cell is able to respond to the presence of glucose by a series of signal trans-duction pathways that are regulated based on the concentrations  of  extracellular  and  intracellular glucose, related metabolites, and flux through key glycolytic  enzymes.  This  includes  activation  of a range of genes that function as transcriptional regulators, and those that are involved in glucose sensing and sugar uptake (for a comprehensive review see Conrad et al., 2014). Although many of the regulatory activities are believed to operate at the transcription regulation level, some may also act directly on specific respiratory enzymes, including those involved in gluconeogenesis, the Krebs cycle, and mitochondrial function and main-tenance (Käppeli, 1986). It should be noted that despite effort in this direction, at the present time much is still unknown about glucose sensing and its regulatory mechanisms in S. cerevisiae, while in other yeast species it remains largely unexplored. However, it is likely that the underlying principles behind glucose repression are similar among yeasts, even if the precise mechanisms differ.
Although many yeasts are subject to the long-term Crabtree effect, the reason why this form of metabolism has evolved is dificult to explain, especially since fermentation has a significantly lower ATP yield than respiration. However, it has been suggested that the long-term Crabtree effect is essentially an evolutionary extension of overflow metabolism (Hagman and Piskur, 2015), while the acceleration of glycolysis and the preference for alcohol production is also likely to function to create a hostile environment for competitors as part of a MAC strategy. In addition, it is possible that rapid sugar uptake can be considered to be a form of glucose scavenging, inhibiting growth of other microbes by starvation, while others have argued that the Crabtree effect evolved simply due to the benefits associated with an overall increase in the rate of ATP production (Pfeiffer and Morley,
312 |  Powell and Kerruish


2014). In the context of beer-spoiling yeasts, the fact that many species are not Crabtree-positive, or that they exhibit either a short-term response or a ‘weaker’ long-term response overall is significant. For example, purely respiring yeast species such as Kluyveromyces marxianus or Candida utilis may need to adopt other strategies to limit the glycolytic rate if a metabolic overflow is encountered. This may manifest in regulation of sugar uptake, formation of glycerol, or in the production of intracellular reserve carbohydrates (glycogen/trehalose). There is also likely to be an impact based on niche development, which may ultimately determine which species are likely to compete with production stains during fer-mentation. Crabtree-negative yeasts will inevitably be less competitive than production strains during fermentation and will only be able to survive at low concentrations, hence one of the reasons why they are typically associated with alternative processing stages.

The Custers effect
The  Custers  effect  was  first  observed  during analysis  of  Brettanomyces  strains  isolated  from lambic-style beers (for a review, see Barnett and Entian, 2005). In contrast to the Pasteur effect, Custers-positive yeast ferment glucose to ethanol faster when oxygen is present than when anaerobic conditions are applied. The reason for this is related to the capacity of cells to convert acetaldehyde into acetic acid (Scheffers, 1961, 1979). This acid production has also been implicated in a MAC strategy, whereby the population is able to create a temporary pH-hostile environment that eliminates or restricts the growth of competitors, before being re-assimilated for an energetic gain (Fig. 11.6). However, the initial process of generating acetic acid requires the reduction of NAD+  to NADH, causing  a  cellular  redox  balance  disparity  that must be restored. This imbalance is compounded by  the  fact  that  Custers-positive  Brettanomyces strains lack the cellular machinery to synthesize glycerol, which can act as an important mechanism for NAD+ regeneration (Wijsman et al., 1984). In the absence of oxygen, the cell cannot readily re-oxidize NADH and so the glycolytic pathway is restricted and the rate of fermentation decreases. Conversely, under aerobic conditions the yeasts cir-cumvent this issue by increasing the glycolytic rate and diverting a proportion of carbon flux towards

the production of ethanol in order to regenerate NAD+  rapidly (van Dijken and Scheffers, 1986), although it should be noted that cellular oxygen (i.e. the respiratory chain) can also perform this function. With regard to the Custers effect, there is also considerable variation between strains, which may also be influenced by media composition and other regulatory mechanisms. For example, nitrate assimilation  is  believed  to  prevent  the  Custers effect  from  occurring  since  cells  can  replenish the NADH pool through reduction of nitrate to ammonium (Steensels et al., 2015). Furthermore, Crabtree-negative yeasts only respire under aerobic conditions and consequently would not be subject to the Custer effect at all.

The Kluyver effect
Although brewing production strains can metabo-lize sugars eficiently under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, some yeast species cannot utilize the fermentative pathway eficiently in the presence of certain sugars. This phenomenon is known as the Klyuver effect and describes the process whereby specific sugars can only be metabolized aerobi-cally. Yeast species that are subject to this effect are often referred to as being ‘respiration dependent’ or ‘Kluyver effect positive’ for a specific sugar, the nature of which can vary between organisms. For example, the Kluyver effect can be observed in Kluyveromyces wickerhamii in response to lactose, in Debaryomyces yamadae in the presence of sucrose, and in Pichia heimeii and Candida utilis in response to maltose. Consequently, it can be seen that, in contrast to the other metabolic effects described above, the Kluyver effect has broad specifications and wide-ranging consequences; a yeast species may be Kluyver effect positive for some sugars but not others. Furthermore, many Kluyver-positive yeasts are often able to ferment glucose eficiently, as  well  as  some  of  the  component  parts  (i.e. hexoses) of oligosaccharides. To simplify things slightly, the Kluyver effect is not observed in the majority  of  species  that  have  a  predominantly fermentative  metabolism,  including  Saccharomy-ces yeasts. However, it is frequently observed in facultatively fermentative yeasts, especially those displaying poor or weak fermentation properties (Sims and Barnett, 1978).
The  precise  reasons  why  the  Kluyver  effect occurs are unknown, and indeed it is perplexing
Beer-spoiling Yeasts |  313


that a particular yeast may be able to utilize glucose under anaerobic conditions but not maltose, which is a disaccharide comprising 2 glucose units. How-ever, there is strong evidence to suggest that the Kluyver effect is linked to sugar transporters within the cell membrane. The uptake of certain sugars may be restricted due to the general reduction in ATP synthesis associated with anaerobic metabo-lism. This acts to limit proton pump activity (since this is an energy-dependent transport mechanism) and consequently cells are unable to eficiently assimilate these sugars (Barnett, 1992). Essentially, the low level of sugar transporter activity observed in Kluyver effect positive yeast is not suficient to sustain the high substrate flow necessary for robust fermentative growth (Goffrini et al., 2002). Hence, it is also likely that the level of sugar transport activ-ity under anaerobic conditions may at least partially determine whether a yeast is Kluyver-positive or -negative for a specific sugar (Fukuhara, 2003). If this is indeed the case then this has implications for interpreting the Kluyver effect, especially since it is known that the transport activity for a given sugar can vary significantly within a species. It is also pos-sible that other factors may be involved, albeit to a lesser extent. This may include the effects of redox imbalance (in highly aerobic yeasts), the relative decrease  in  activity  of  pyruvate  decarboxylase, product inhibition (specifically ethanol), and the relationship between anaerobiosis and sugar carrier properties, as reviewed by Fukuhara (2003) and Barnett and Entian (2005). From the perspective of beer-spoiling yeasts, the Kluyver effect predomi-nantly influences the capacity of a strain to compete with the production yeast. For example, yeasts that are Kluyver effect positive for maltose are unlikely to be a serious threat during fermentation. How-ever, it is important to note that such yeasts may survive at low concentrations or be able to thrive at different stages of the process.


Frequency and control of beer-spoiling yeasts

Incidences of beer-spoiling yeasts in breweries
In comparison to reports of bacterial contamination, there are relatively few surveys documenting the occurrence of yeast contaminants within breweries.

It is debatable why this is the case; either they are genuinely less problematic, or their presence goes largely unnoticed owing to dificulties in isolat-ing and detecting beer-spoiling yeasts. It is also worth noting that contamination is often not as pronounced as with bacterial species and therefore yeast contaminants may remain unnoticed since only minor changes to fermentation performance or flavour profiles are observed, and these may be erroneously attributed to other sources.
In one major study, van der Aa Kühle and Jes-persen (1998) analysed 101 cropped yeast samples obtained  from  45  lager  breweries.  These  were assessed for yeast contamination by plating samples of yeast collected from fermentation vessels onto selective media. In total, 41 of the samples ana-lysed (representing 24 breweries) were identified as containing beer-spoiling yeasts. In total, 126 beer-spoiling yeasts were isolated and identified to the species level, a frequency that was consider-ably higher than expected. Saccharomyces species accounted for more than 57% of the infections detected, with Pichia and Candida representing 28% and 15% of the contaminants isolated, respec-tively. In the same study, the capacity of the isolated yeast strains to grow in de-carbonated beer and wort were also examined. Most strains investigated were capable of growth in both wort (99%) and beer (98%). Further analysis revealed that inocula-tion of 26 of the isolated strains into bottled lager beer resulted in significantly reduced survival and growth. Eight of these isolates were not able to grow in bottled beer even when incubated for 17 days at 21°C. For those isolates that were able to grow, most demonstrated moderate replication potential and a few showed rapid growth. In a separate study, Pham et al. (2011) analysed yeast contaminants isolated from conditioning tanks and fermentation vessels. Analysis of fermentation samples indicated that 90% of isolates were Saccharomyces species, while 61% of samples from conditioning tanks belonged to the Pichia genus (either P. fermentans or P. membranifaciens). This was perhaps surpris-ing, given that Pichia are primarily aerobic yeasts. However, these data highlight the possible effects of oxygen in beer post fermentation; in this instance, it is possible that air was either the direct cause of the contamination, or more likely that it facilitated the growth of the Pichia yeast, which had survived through fermentation at subdetection levels.

Irrespective of the source and nature of yeast contamination, there is a range of consequences. These  include  having  a  direct  negative  impact on product quality and consistency, while also increasing  product  wastage  through  disposal  of contaminated beer. If a contamination issue is not addressed then this could also lead to complaints from the market, bruised consumer confidence, decreased brand loyalty, and potentially a trade recall.

Control of beer-spoiling yeasts
The potential for contamination by beer-spoiling yeasts is largely determined by the level of hygiene applied throughout the brewing chain. The pos-sibility of introducing beer-spoiling yeasts should be eliminated by ensuring that equipment is sterile, and that the pitching culture is free of contami-nants. With respect to raw materials arriving from an external source, confidence should be assured by accreditation systems such as ISO 9001. However, brewers should still be aware of the microbiological risk associated with water, barley, hops, adjuncts, and culture yeast. For some raw materials, this may necessitate extra analyses; for example, where water is sourced from wells or boreholes the risk of con-tamination should be considered and an appropriate general microbiological sampling plan generated. Similar strategies should be implemented to check for the presence of beer-spoiling yeasts within the brewery on a routine basis. On a practical level, this inevitably involves sampling wherever there is a high risk of microbial contamination, including raw materials such as primings or dry hops. This should also include areas associated with yeast propaga-tion, fermentation and conditioning tanks, yeast storage vessels (brinks), and the packaging line.
Arguably the easiest way that a yeast contami-nant can be introduced into the brewery is via the pitching yeast. At the simplest level, breweries that regularly use several yeast strains have a greater chance of observing cross-contamination. How-ever, in all breweries where yeast is propagated in-house (see Chapter 3), contaminated slopes or ampoules pose a significant microbiological risk as any undesirable yeasts that are present will be cultivated as part of the yeast propagation process. Consequently,  the  routine  yeast  supply  process should be designed such that there is confidence that the yeast is contamination free. Key stages

include  long-term  storage  of  yeast,  removal  of yeast stocks from storage, and the initial cultiva-tion of biomass. Third-party suppliers are often used to store yeast strains and to provide working cultures to individual breweries on request. These companies typically perform a series of quality-assurance checks to ensure that the culture is pure, free of mutations, and of the correct strain. Once the yeast propagation process is initiated, human error represents the greatest threat; poor aseptic technique, failure to follow the correct procedures, or a lack of understanding about the potential risks of beer-spoiling yeast can all lead to contamination. Within the laboratory, each step of the propagation process should ideally be performed in a laminar flow hood, or alternatively close to a Bunsen burner using  appropriate  aseptic  technique.  The  yeast growth media should be sterile before inoculation, preferably by autoclaving at 121°C and 15psi for 15 minutes, and the sterility of any air or oxygen introduced should be assured by passing through a sterile filter. Once the biomass is suficient to seed the brewery propagation vessel, transferral of yeast should be carefully monitored. Correct propaga-tion management at the plant level can also assist in ensuring the absence of beer-spoiling yeasts and should involve regular microbiological checks on equipment, cooled wort and sterile air lines, as well as equipment used for the transport and storage of pitching yeast. If contamination is found at any point, it is best practice to immediately discard the culture, re-initiate the process of yeast supply, and implement a rigorous cleaning regime. It should be noted that although acid washing may be used to control spoilage bacterial contamination, this has no effect on beer-spoiling yeast.
For smaller brewing companies, yeast cultures may be obtained from a variety of sources, includ-ing manufacturers of active dried yeast (ADY), liquid yeast suppliers, or cooperative neighbouring breweries. While the microbiological quality of the latter is largely dependent on the brewer, suppli-ers of yeast cultures in pitchable quantities (ADY or liquid yeast) will typically perform a check for yeast contaminants as part of their routine quality assurance prior to sale. However it is also advisable to conduct analyses in-house to confirm purity of the culture, even if this only provides retrospective information.
Although  brewers  should  strive  for  absolute
Beer-spoiling Yeasts |  315


sterility, in reality many will accept slightly lower standards (often unknowingly) that are suficient to ensure that the final product is not compromised. Historically, the critical level was considered to be around 4–10 cells per bottle (Brumstead and Glen-ister, 1962), since yeast would not be competitive at lower concentrations. However, current consensus is that for most yeasts, there is no ‘safe’ level and best practice is to maintain a high degree of hygiene throughout the brewing process (van der Aa Kühle and Jespersen, 1998). With regard to general brew-ery hygiene, the reader is directed to a thorough recent review (Davies et al., 2015); however, it is important to note that a well-designed plant greatly mitigates microbial contamination. Internal sur-faces should be smooth and dead-legs in pipework should be avoided. Areas that cannot be effectively sterilized using cleaning in place (CIP) pose a considerable contamination risk. The CIP system employed within a plant should be effective with spray balls or rotating spray heads able to deliver the appropriate cleaning agents at the correct pressure and for the required time. It should be noted that many beer-spoiling yeasts can be airborne; surfaces that may have become contaminated should not be ‘hosed down’ as this can create an aerosol that could potentially act as a conduit for further contamina-tion.
When considering beer quality overall, it is also important to recognize that opportunities for spoil-age also occur at the point of sale (Quain, 2016). In particular, ale-type products in cask, and dispense systems  in  general,  can  provide  a  semi-aerobic environment in which many beer-spoiling yeasts are able to proliferate. Typically, these yeasts are opportunistic contaminants that are able to thrive where a combination of poor hygiene and bad practice provides the opportunity for proliferation. Unfortunately for the brewer, once the beer leaves the brewery they often have little influence on the product or the standards of hygiene applied. How-ever, adhering to best practice for the sanitation of dispense equipment and using inert gas to prevent air ingress into casks can minimize risk at this stage.


Detection and identification
At critical stages of the brewing process it is good microbiological   practice   to   conduct   tests   to detect the presence of unwanted microorganisms.

Unfortunately,  while  many  brewers  implement strategies for monitoring bacterial species, many do not test for beer-spoiling yeasts, or do so only infrequently. If a beer-spoiling yeast is detected, it is often useful to identify the species since this information can assist in determining if a recurring issue has presented itself. Furthermore, identifying the species may give clues as to the source of the contamination and the best course of action for elimination. Traditional methods based on growth properties are still widely employed for the detec-tion of yeasts, despite a growing range of alternative rapid methods. The reason for this is that using culture media is relatively simple, cheap, and pro-vides robust information on the presence of viable organisms. Alternative methods for detection may not meet all of these criteria and hence are typi-cally used alongside traditional methods, perhaps to speed up an initial diagnosis. In contrast, novel methods for the identification of beer-spoiling yeast have been broadly accepted and are implemented in most large brewing companies. There are now many techniques available to identify yeasts to the genus, species, or strain level, and although some of these can be easily conducted in-house, third-party labo-ratories can also perform such analysis relatively quickly and without huge cost.

Isolating beer-spoiling yeasts
Traditional techniques used to isolate yeast con-taminants in breweries are largely based on the cultivation and growth requirements of the genus and species involved. Such techniques are popular since they are relatively easy to implement; how-ever, results are typically available only several days or even weeks after beer has been packaged. These techniques therefore only offer a retrospective view of final product quality and do not allow for proac-tive process control.
The most common means of detecting beer-spoiling yeast within the brewery is to cultivate unknown  samples  (collected  either  via  direct sampling or by filtration of liquids) on selective nutrient media. These media types are designed to either promote the growth of spoilage yeasts or to restrict growth (e.g. of brewing strains or bacterial species). Given that organisms frequently exhibit different growth requirements, variations in carbon or nitrogen source, nutrient composition, and aero-bic conditions are invariably used in media for the
316 |  Powell and Kerruish


isolation of beer-spoiling yeasts. At the most basic level,  Wallerstein  Laboratory  Nutrient  (WLN) media can be employed as this supports the growth of a range of microbes; by incorporating tetracy-cline or chloramphenicol, it is possible to prevent bacterial  growth,  providing  specificity  for  yeast cultivation. More specific media for yeast detec-tion include CLEN (cadaverine, lysine, ethylamine, and  nitrate  medium),  Lins  wild  yeast  medium (LWYM),  lysine  medium,  MYGP+copper,  and XMACS (Table 11.5). The use of these media types can facilitate the detection of either Saccharomyces or non-Saccharomyces strains, or both. However, in reality it is good practice to employ more than one type of media to detect a broad range of yeasts. For example, many breweries will conduct testing using MYGP+copper to isolate non-production strains in conjunction with lysine media to test for non-Saccharomyces yeasts.

Traditional methods for characterizing beer-spoiling yeasts
Identifying yeasts using traditional methods is a complex and inexact process. Direct microscopy is useful in determining cell structure, budding pat-terns, the presence of pseudohyphae, and the shape of spores (if present). This can be supplemented with analysis of phenotypic traits including fermen-tation of sugars, production of acids, and a range of

biochemical tests to determine nutritional depend-encies. The latter can be facilitated by the use of commercially  available  API  strips  (Biomerieux, France). However, although they have been widely used for analysis of clinical isolates, their use within the brewing industry to date has been limited. Other methods that are more accurate but have yet to be fully translated to the brewing industry include matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF MS) (Usbeck et al., 2014; see Chapter 7), as well as pyrolysis mass spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy  (FTIR)  (Timmins  et  al., 1998), which allow species differentiation based on mass fingerprinting. These offer interesting oppor-tunities since production strain data can be stored in  databases,  allowing  quick  and  precise  com-parisons between unknown samples to be made. Other methods include profiling of total fatty acids based on determination of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) compounds (Timke et al., 2008), protein fingerprinting (Kobi et al., 2004), and immunolog-ical-based methods, which employ species-specific monoclonal  antibodies  to  detect  organisms  by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assays  (ELISA) (Kuniyuki et al., 1984). In addition, techniques can be applied to characterize unknown yeasts by deter-mining spoilage characteristics based on phenotype analysis. Examples include testing for acetic acid or

phenolic compounds, both of which are obvious by performing a basic sniff test. Although care should always be taken when snifing ‘unknown’ laboratory samples, by inoculating a suspected beer-spoiling yeast into media comprising ferulic acid, POF+ yeast can be detected due to the production of a medicinal-like (phenolic/clove) aroma, typical of 4-vinylguiacol (Cowley et al., 2016).

Traditional methods for differentiation of production strains and variants
Ale and lager yeast strains can be readily differenti-ated based on key physiological characteristics. For example, ale strains are able to grow on solid media and form colonies at 37°C while lager strains are not. In addition, the ability of lager strains to utilize meli-biose can be exploited using X-α-Gal based medium. This medium determines the capacity of yeast to cleave the melibiose homologue X-α-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside), resulting  in  the  development  of  a  blue/green coloration derived from indol. While this is tradi-tionally conducted using solid media, more rapid results can be obtained using a revised protocol where cells are suspended in liquid media and results obtained within one hour (Box et al., 2012). Differentiation of production strains of the same type is more challenging, particularly if the strains in question are both S. pastorianus. Most ale strains show differences in giant colony morphology when grown for an extended period of time on WLN or gelatin-based media (Morris and Hough, 1958). For differentiation of lager strains, a number of methods have been used with varying degrees of success. Ultimately, without undertaking molecular analyses, often the best means of determining strain identity is to conduct some form of test to examine known fermentation characteristics, such as floccu-lation capacity or sugar utilization patterns.
Variants create similar problems and typically necessitate precise phenotypic analyses, as is the case for cultures that display enhanced or reduced flocculation patterns. In this instance, flocculation tests such as the modified Helm assay (Bendiak et al., 1996) can be applied. Respiratory-deficient petite mutants (see Chapter 2) can be detected by growth on glycerol-based media since petites are unable to grow only on media containing only non-fermentable carbon sources. Alternatively, these

can also be identified using the TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) overlay technique. In this method, the colourless TTC stain is poured over colonies present on the surface of an agar plate. The TTC dye is reduced by respiratory-suficient yeasts to form a pinkish red colour. Respiratory-deficient yeast colonies cannot reduce the dye and remain white (Ogur et al., 1957).

Alternative methods for yeast detection and identification
Although the detection methods described above provide accurate and reliable information on the presence of culturable (live) cells, these tests can be  labour-intensive  and  require  anywhere  from 3–14 days to obtain results. This has prompted alternative techniques to be developed that are less laborious and provide results more rapidly, result-ing in a more immediate, rather than retrospective, process analysis. Although there are many methods available  for  detection  of  beer-spoiling  yeasts, the most widely employed are those that utilize polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  technology. This technique permits the amplification of DNA fragments (corresponding to specific organisms) by several orders of magnitude over a few hours. Consequently, using PCR it is possible to amplify extremely small amounts of DNA to levels that can be used for detection and identification purposes; an approach that lends itself to forensic science, medical microbiology, food microbiology, as well as brewing quality assurance. The PCR procedure consists of repeated cycles of DNA denaturation, primer annealing, and extension by DNA polymer-ase, and relies on the selection of a DNA sequence that adequately differentiates the genotype of one organism  from  another.  The  amplified  DNA  is then visualized either by gel electrophoresis in conjunction with a DNA stain such as ethidium bromide (standard PCR), or by using primers in conjunction with a probe to provide a quantita-tive indication of PCR amplification through the production of fluorescence (quantitative real-time PCR, or qPCR). One basic example is to employ primers designed for detection of the STA1 gene responsible for diastatic activity in Saccharomyces strains (Yamauchi et al., 1998), although a range of DNA sequences that are unique to different species can be exploited.

It  is  relatively  common  for  larger  brewing companies  to  use  commercially  available  PCR kits, as these provide a rapid and reliable means of  both  detecting  and  identifying  beer-spoiling yeasts in a single reaction. Implementation of PCR technology has gained momentum since the first commercially available kits became available in the early 2000s. These have gained in popularity, partly because of the development of equivalent method-ology for bacterial detection, which allows a range of brewing microbes to be investigated in parallel. However, the primary reason is that such methods are easy to perform on a routine basis and provide results that are often supported by data available on-line, allowing for increased confidence in the data obtained. Despite this, it should be recognized that such tools are not amenable to many brewery laboratories since the level of expertise required is relatively high and costs are often prohibitive. In addition, there are still issues with regard to inhi-bition of the PCR reaction by beer components, and the fact that PCR methods do not easily dis-criminate between live and dead cells. Finally, the level of sensitivity remains low (around 1×102 – 1 103  cells/ml), which often necessitate a period of ‘pre-enrichment’ to ensure that false negatives are eliminated. As a result of these factors, many breweries continue to perform traditional testing as a back-up measure, indicating that there may still be an element of caution in relying solely on PCR. Despite this, due to the advances in next-generation sequencing, it is likely that DNA-based techniques will continue to develop. The capacity to identify beer-spoiling yeast species by mechanisms such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FisH) (Xufre et al., 2006), or PCR analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Wilkening et al., 2013) or ribosomal DNA sequence divergence offer interesting opportunities for the future.

Molecular methods for identification of beer-spoiling yeast species
As described above (see ‘Detection and identifica-tion’), methods for identification of yeasts were historically based on physiological characteristics, including  sexual  reproduction  (where  present), cell morphology, growth characteristics, and bio-chemical features. Some of these criteria are still utilized today for characterizing yeasts, although for

identification purposes analysis of DNA homology is increasingly the most widely accepted method. Once a beer-spoiling yeast has been isolated, it can be identified to the genus and species level by analysing specific regions of DNA. These regions are typically selected based on specific criteria and should demonstrate a high degree of interspecific polymorphism and a low or non-existent intra-specific polymorphism. This enables the sequence to  be  used  to  accurately  differentiate  between species, but also provides a robust means of ensur-ing that all strains within a species yield identical results. There are several regions of the genome that meet these criteria, with the most widely used being those located within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence, coding for the ribosomal RNA. The rDNA contains tracts designated as 26S, 5S, 18S, 5.8S and 26S, which are highly conserved and arranged in tandem units (Fig. 11.7). These genes are separated by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and non-transcribed spacer (NTS) regions, both of which are non-coding, highly variable, and match the criteria outlined above for classification purposes. Studies have shown that the ITS region is particularly useful for identification of yeasts to the genus and species level and this has recently been proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker (Schoch et al., 2012). In addition, a small region of the 26S subunit known as the D1/ D2 domain can be employed to accurately identify yeast species. Analysis of this region is important from a phylogenetic perspective as it has previously acted as one of the predominant means of confirm-ing existing taxonomic groupings and in identifying novel yeast species (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998; Weiss et al., 2013).

D1/D2 sequencing
The D1/D2 region of the 26S subunit was previ-ously  adopted  as  a  convenient  mechanism  for characterizing yeast to the species level. By analys-ing this sequence, Kurtzman and Robnett (1998) were able to identify a large number of yeast species based on sequence divergence within the D1/D2 domain. These authors demonstrated that strains belonging to a species exhibited less than 1% dif-ference within the D1/D2 sequence, while distinct species  had  a  much  greater  variation.  Analysis of the D1/D2 domain can be conducted using a

Figure 11.7 Identification of yeast species based on analysis of ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Several sections of the rRNA gene region are variable between species but conserved between strains, including the D1/D2 domain of the 26S subunit, and the ITS and NTS regions. The D1/D2 domain is typically analysed by PCR followed by sequencing of the ≈600bp fragment. The ITS region (including the 5.8S region) can be amplified in its entirety by primers designed to target the ends of the 18S (small subunit) and 26S (large subunit) ribosomal RNA genes (1). The PCR product is then cut using restriction enzymes (2) to yield a number of DNA fragments that can be resolved using gel electrophoresis (3). The sizes of each resulting fragment (along with that of the original PCR product) are determined by comparison to a DNA ladder (molecular weight marker). For analysis of species using ITS or NTS RFLP, or D1/D2 sequencing, identification is based on comparison to the literature, or to an internal or external database.

combination of PCR and DNA sequencing. PCR is required to amplify the region of interest, gen-erating an amplicon of ≈600bp based on targeted primers (Table 11.6). This region is then sequenced to allow for the generation of qualitative data that can be analysed using sequence alignment soft-ware or compared directly to a database. There are

several sources of reference that can be used, many of which are freely available online. This is most easily performed by conducting a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis of deposited sequences that are maintained in databases such as GenBank or the YeastIP gene database for molecu-lar taxonomy and phylogeny of yeasts (Weiss et al.,
320 |  Powell and Kerruish


2013). Either approach can be used to calculate phylogenetic relationships, as well as for the identi-fication of unknown species.

ITS/NTS PCR
Analysis of the ITS region has gained significant traction and is currently preferred to other methods for yeast identification (Schoch et al., 2012). How-ever, in some instances the NTS region can also be used to good effect, being useful for the differentia-tion of Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts (Pulvirenti et al., 2000) and Kluyveromyces species (Nguyen et al., 2000). Analysis of these sequences typically involves a preliminary PCR reaction using specific primers (Table 11.6) to amplify the designated region, and to create a suficient quantity of DNA, which can then be analysed by alternative methods. For analysis of the ITS region, this can include analysis for total length polymorphism, restriction fragment  length  polymorphism  (RFLP),  DNA probe  hybridization,  and  DNA  sequencing.  Of these, DNA sequencing is the most precise due to the vast number of full-length ITS sequences that have been deposited in databases such as GenBank. However, for brewery troubleshooting purposes RFLP tends to be used preferentially, simply due to the speed and ease at which the technique can be conducted. RFLP is a term used to describe the analysis of DNA fragments, obtained by the use of specific enzymes that cut at pre-designated loca-tions within a DNA sequence. Restriction enzymes, originally isolated from bacteria, cut at recognition sites within the DNA giving rise to multiple frag-ments that can then be separated by electrophoresis (Fig. 11.7). The application of these enzymes pro-vides a useful means of identifying yeast species, since the enzymes utilized can be selected based on their capacity to cut at a location known to high-light polymorphisms between species and genera. Since the development of the technique, a series of studies have been performed, primarily to identify important yeast strains isolated from wine (Guil-lamón et al., 1998; Esteve-Zarzoso et al., 1999), but also from clinical sources (Trost et al., 2004; Leaw et al., 2006) and a range of industrial environments including breweries (Pham et al., 2011).
The primers used for amplification of the ITS region are known to have near universal function with ascomycete yeasts (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1991) and the majority of studies employ the

restriction enzymes CfoI, HinfI and HaeIII for increasing specificity. This is primarily because they have been proven to have highly suitable restriction sites. The size of the ITS region varies between spe-cies from approximately 300bp to 1000bp, which does allow for some differentiation, particularly at the genus level. However, individual species can only be reliably differentiated based on either RFLP  or  sequence-based  analysis  as  described above. Due to a combination of the size of the ITS fragment and the restriction enzyme cutting site, the size and number of restriction fragments yielded by RFLP analysis differs according to spe-cies (Table 11.7). It should be noted that strains belonging to the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group exhibit ITS sequences in the region of 840–880bp in size, a feature which can be used to immediately differentiate them from non-Saccharomyces con-taminants. Within the sensu stricto group there are less obvious differences that can cause issues, especially if contamination or a mix-up between production yeasts is suspected. In such instances, further identification is required. There are a large number of molecular-based techniques that can be used to differentiate yeasts to the strain level. While this list is by no means exhaustive, methods that are known to be successful include analysis of yeast transposons (Wightman et al., 1996), micro- and mini- satellites (Baleiras Couto et al., 1996; Pérez et al., 2001; Schuller et al., 2004), chromosomal karyotyping (Schwartz and Cantor, 1984; Casey et al., 1990; Oakley-Gutowski et al., 1991; Boekhout et al., 1993; Casey, 1996), inter-delta sequence fingerprinting (Ness et al., 1993; Legras and Karst, 2003), mitochondrial DNA profiling (Aigle et al., 1984; López et al., 2001), and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Ben-Ari et al., 2005; Schacherer et al., 2007, 2009).


Conclusions
Irrespective of their characteristics and threat to the process, the presence of beer-spoiling yeasts within the brewery is often an indication of poor general hygiene. If left to proliferate, unwanted yeasts can lead to a range of issues, including spoilage of raw materials and the production of off-flavours, as well as fermentation inconsistencies and poor ethanol yields. The occurrence of spoilage yeasts can also lead to confusion within breweries, since many

strains are able to survive within the culture yeast population at relatively low levels and without any noticeable impact on product quality. For example, there have been occasions where brewing yeast populations have shown a cyclical deterioration in quality towards the end of fermentation and in storage vessels (in the region of a 3–5% reduc-tion in overall viability). This can be linked to the physiological characteristics of non-Saccharomyces yeasts, which are often pH and ethanol sensitive. These individuals are less able to tolerate condi-tions encountered at the end of fermentation and dead cells are therefore a function of the presence of  physiologically  ‘weaker’  yeast  contaminants. Hence, while there are certain broader aspects of contamination that are simple to define, it is impor-tant to be aware that there may also be a range of additional associated affects.
Although  hygiene  in  the  brewery  is  usually attended to assiduously, contamination of process stages or the final product with yeasts may be more frequent than the majority of brewers would acknowledge. Saccharomyces beer-spoiling yeasts, which include other production strains and vari-ants, pose the greatest threat to the fermentation

process since they are able to compete directly with the culture yeast. Non-Saccharomyces yeasts such as Brettanomyces, Candida, Kluyveromyces, Pichia and Torulaspora are opportunistic spoilers that can be found in the initial aerobic stages of fermentation and in unpasteurized cask beers. Brettanomyces is a particular threat in cask beer due to its ability to form high concentrations of acetic acid. It should be noted that although breweries may encounter repeat problems with specific yeast strains, it is not common for isolated outbreaks involving different species to occur.
Currently,   the   preferred   methodology   in breweries for the detection of yeast contaminants remains the use of nutrient media. Although gener-ally slow, the technique is robust and allows for the detection of small quantities of beer-spoiling yeast, even when large numbers of brewing yeast are present. However, cultivation-based methods are increasingly used in conjunction with more rapid techniques. Real-time PCR analysis in particular offers an alternative means of detecting and identi-fying beer-spoiling yeasts, leading to faster decision time and more eficient quality-control procedures. If the presence of a beer-spoiling yeast is confirmed,

identification can be an aid to fully understanding the root causes of the problem. Eradication should be based on a systematic procedure of investigation and sterilization to eliminate the source of the issue.

Brewing Microbiology

Current Research, Omics and Microbial Ecology




Research into brewing yeast and other organisms associated with beer and brewing has experienced many important advances in the past decade, propelled by technological advances in tools fundamental to the investigation of microbes and their metabolism.

This  volume  surveys  the  most  recent  discoveries  in  brewing microbiology, with an emphasis on omics techniques and other modern technologies. Discoveries in these areas have furthered our knowledge of brewing processes, with practical applications from barley growth and malting to yeast management, strain selection,  fermentation  control,  and  quality  assurance.  The chapters, written by experts in the field, aim not only to illuminate recent  progress,  but  also  to  discuss  its  impact  on  brewing practices. Topics covered include the physiology, fermentation, taxonomy, diversity, typing, genetic manipulation, genomics and evolution of brewing yeasts. Further areas covered include the fungal contamination of barley and malt, spoilage by lactic acid bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, and beer-spoiling yeasts.

This volume is highly recommended for anyone involved in the microbiology of brewing.
